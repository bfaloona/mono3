          See see, my beauty will be saved by merit!<br>
O heresy in fair, fit for these days!<br>
A giving hand, though foul, shall have fair praise.<br>
But come, the bow: now mercy goes to kill,<br>
And shooting well is then accounted ill.<br>
Thus will I save my credit in the shoot:<br>
Not wounding, pity would not let me do't;<br>
If wounding, then it was to show my skill,<br>
That more for praise than purpose meant to kill.<br>
And out of question so it is sometimes,<br>
Glory grows guilty of detested crimes,<br>
When, for fame's sake, for praise, an outward part,<br>
We bend to that the working of the heart; <br>
As I for praise alone now seek to spill<br>
The poor deer's blood, that my heart means no ill.
