      <div class="monologue_preview">
          All places yield to him ere he sits down;<br>
And the nobility of Rome are his:<br>
The senators and patricians love him too:<br>
The tribunes are no soldiers; and their people<br>
Will be as rash in the repeal, as hasty <br>
To expel him thence. I think he'll be to Rome<br>
As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it<br>
By sovereignty of nature. First he was<br>
A noble servant to them; but he could not<br>
Carry his honours even: whether 'twas pride, <br>
Which out of daily fortune ever taints<br>
The happy man; whether defect of judgment,<br>
To fail in the disposing of those chances<br>
Which he was lord of; or whether nature,<br>
Not to be other than one thing, not moving<br>
From the casque to the cushion, but commanding peace<br>
Even with the same austerity and garb<br>
As he controll'd the war; but one of theseâ€”<br>
As he hath spices of them all, not all,<br>
For I dare so far free himâ€”made him fear'd, <br>
So hated, and so banish'd: but he has a merit,<br>
To choke it in the utterance. So our virtues<br>
Lie in the interpretation of the time:<br>
And power, unto itself most commendable,<br>
Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair <br>
To extol what it hath done.<br>
One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;<br>
Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.<br>
Come, let's away. When, Caius, Rome is thine,<br>
Thou art poor'st of all; then shortly art thou mine.
