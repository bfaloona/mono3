          My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,<br>
Which can interpret further: only, I say,<br>
Things have been strangely borne. The
gracious Duncan<br>
Was pitied of Macbeth: marry, he was dead: <br>
And the right-valiant Banquo walk'd too late;<br>
Whom, you may say, if't please you, Fleance kill'd,<br>
For Fleance fled: men must not walk too late.<br>
Who cannot want the thought how monstrous<br>
It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain <br>
To kill their gracious father? damned fact!<br>
How it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight<br>
In pious rage the two delinquents tear,<br>
That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?<br>
Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too; <br>
For 'twould have anger'd any heart alive<br>
To hear the men deny't. So that, I say,<br>
He has borne all things well: and I do think<br>
That had he Duncan's sons under his key--<br>
As, an't please heaven, he shall not--they 
should find<br>
What 'twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.<br>
But, peace! for from broad words and 'cause he fail'd<br>
His presence at the tyrant's feast, I hear<br>
Macduff lives in disgrace: sir, can you tell <br>
Where he bestows himself?
