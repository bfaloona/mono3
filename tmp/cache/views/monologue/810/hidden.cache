          Nor for yours neither. You've ungently, Brutus,<br>
Stole from my bed: and yesternight, at supper, <br>
You suddenly arose, and walk'd about,<br>
Musing and sighing, with your arms across,<br>
And when I ask'd you what the matter was,<br>
You stared upon me with ungentle looks;<br>
I urged you further; then you scratch'd your head, <br>
And too impatiently stamp'd with your foot;<br>
Yet I insisted, yet you answer'd not,<br>
But, with an angry wafture of your hand,<br>
Gave sign for me to leave you: so I did;<br>
Fearing to strengthen that impatience <br>
Which seem'd too much enkindled, and withal<br>
Hoping it was but an effect of humour,<br>
Which sometime hath his hour with every man.<br>
It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep,<br>
And could it work so much upon your shape <br>
As it hath much prevail'd on your condition,<br>
I should not know you, Brutus. Dear my lord,<br>
Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.
