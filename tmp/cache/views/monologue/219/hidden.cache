      <div class="monologue_preview">
          My liege, I did deny no prisoners.<br>
But I remember, when the fight was done, <br>
When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,<br>
Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,<br>
Came there a certain lord, neat, and trimly dress'd,<br>
Fresh as a bridegroom; and his chin new reap'd<br>
Show'd like a stubble-land at harvest-home; <br>
He was perfumed like a milliner;<br>
And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held<br>
A pouncet-box, which ever and anon<br>
He gave his nose and took't away again;<br>
Who therewith angry, when it next came there,<br>
Took it in snuff; and still he smiled and talk'd,<br>
And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,<br>
He call'd them untaught knaves, unmannerly,<br>
To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse<br>
Betwixt the wind and his nobility. <br>
With many holiday and lady terms<br>
He question'd me; amongst the rest, demanded<br>
My prisoners in your majesty's behalf.<br>
I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold,<br>
To be so pester'd with a popinjay, <br>
Out of my grief and my impatience,<br>
Answer'd neglectingly I know not what,<br>
He should or he should not; for he made me mad<br>
To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet<br>
And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman <br>
Of guns and drums and wounds,.God save the mark!--<br>
And telling me the sovereign'st thing on earth<br>
Was parmaceti for an inward bruise;<br>
And that it was great pity, so it was,<br>
This villanous salt-petre should be digg'd <br>
Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,<br>
Which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd<br>
So cowardly; and but for these vile guns,<br>
He would himself have been a soldier.<br>
This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,<br>
I answer'd indirectly, as I said;<br>
And I beseech you, let not his report<br>
Come current for an accusation<br>
Betwixt my love and your high majesty.
