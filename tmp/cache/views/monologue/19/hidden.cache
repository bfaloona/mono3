          'Anon he finds him,<br>
Striking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,<br>
Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,<br>
Repugnant to command. Unequal match'd, <br>
Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;<br>
But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword<br>
Th' unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,<br>
Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top<br>
Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash <br>
Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear. For lo! his sword,<br>
Which was declining on the milky head<br>
Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' th' air to stick.<br>
So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,<br>
And, like a neutral to his will and matter,<br>
Did nothing.<br>
But, as we often see, against some storm,<br>
A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,<br>
The bold winds speechless, and the orb below<br>
As hush as death- anon the dreadful thunder <br>
Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause,<br>
Aroused vengeance sets him new awork;<br>
And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall<br>
On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,<br>
With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword<br>
Now falls on Priam.<br>
Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods,<br>
In general synod take away her power;<br>
Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,<br>
And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,<br>
As low as to the fiends! <br>
