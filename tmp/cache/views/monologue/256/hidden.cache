          <b>Juliet.</b> Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,<br>
      That sees into the bottom of my grief?<br>
      O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!<br>
      Delay this marriage for a month, a week;<br>
      Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed <br>
      In that dim monument where Tybalt lies. <br><br>

<del><b>Lady Capulet.</b> Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word:<br>
      Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee. <br><br>

[Exit]</del><br><br>

<b>Juliet.</b> O God!.O nurse, how shall this be prevented?<br>
      My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;<br>
      How shall that faith return again to earth,<br>
      Unless that husband send it me from heaven<br>
      By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.<br>
      Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems<br>
      Upon so soft a subject as myself!<br>
      What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?<br>
      Some comfort, nurse.
