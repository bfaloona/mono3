          Ay, ay; and she hath offer'd to the doom—<br>
Which, unreversed, stands in effectual force—<br>
A sea of melting pearl, which some call tears:<br>
Those at her father's churlish feet she tender'd;<br>
With them, upon her knees, her humble self; <br>
Wringing her hands, whose whiteness so became them<br>
As if but now they waxed pale for woe:<br>
But neither bended knees, pure hands held up,<br>
Sad sighs, deep groans, nor silver-shedding tears,<br>
Could penetrate her uncompassionate sire; <br>
But Valentine, if he be ta'en, must die.<br>
Besides, her intercession chafed him so,<br>
When she for thy repeal was suppliant,<br>
That to close prison he commanded her,<br>
With many bitter threats of biding there.
