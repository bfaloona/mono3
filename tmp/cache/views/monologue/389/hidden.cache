          I have, thou gallant Trojan, seen thee oft<br>
Labouring for destiny make cruel way<br>
Through ranks of Greekish youth, and I have seen thee,<br>
As hot as Perseus, spur thy Phrygian steed,<br>
Despising many forfeits and subduements,<br>
When thou hast hung thy advanced sword i' the air,<br>
Not letting it decline on the declined,<br>
That I have said to some my standers by<br>
'Lo, Jupiter is yonder, dealing life!' <br>
And I have seen thee pause and take thy breath,<br>
When that a ring of Greeks have hemm'd thee in,<br>
Like an Olympian wrestling: this have I seen;<br>
But this thy countenance, still lock'd in steel,<br>
I never saw till now. I knew thy grandsire, <br>
And once fought with him: he was a soldier good;<br>
But, by great Mars, the captain of us all,<br>
Never saw like thee. Let an old man embrace thee;<br>
And, worthy warrior, welcome to our tents.
