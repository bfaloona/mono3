          <b>Fathers' Ghost.</b>    * I am thy father's spirit, <br>
      Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,<br>
      And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,<br>
      Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature<br>
      Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid<br>
      To tell the secrets of my prison house, <br>
      I could a tale unfold whose lightest word<br>
      Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,<br>
      Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,<br>
      Thy knotted and combined locks to part,<br>
      And each particular hair to stand on end <br>
      Like quills upon the fretful porcupine.<br>
      But this eternal blazon must not be<br>
      To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!<br>
      If thou didst ever thy dear father love- <br><br>

    <del><b>Hamlet.</b> O God!</del><br><br>

    <B>Father's Ghost.</b> Revenge his foul and most unnatural murther. <br><br>

    <del><b>Hamlet.</b> Murther?</del><br><br> 

    <b>Father's Ghost.</b> Murther most foul, as in the best it is;<br>
      But this most foul, strange, and unnatural. <br><br>

    <del><b>Hamlet.</b> Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift<br>
      As meditation or the thoughts of love,<br>
      May sweep to my revenge. </del><br><br>

    <b>Father's Ghost.</b> I find thee apt;<br>
      And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed<br>
      That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf, <br>
      Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.<br>
      'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,<br>
      A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark<br>
      Is by a forged process of my death<br>
      Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,<br>
      The serpent that did sting thy father's life<br>
      Now wears his crown. <br><br>

    <del><b>Hamlet.</b> O my prophetic soul!<br>
      My uncle? </del><br><br>

    <b>Father's Ghost.</b> Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,<br>
      With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts-<br>
      O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power<br>
      So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust<br>
      The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.<br>
      O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there,<br>
      From me, whose love was of that dignity<br>
      That it went hand in hand even with the vow<br>
      I made to her in marriage, and to decline<br>
      Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor<br>
      To those of mine! <br>
      But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,<br>
      Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,<br>
      So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,<br>
      Will sate itself in a celestial bed<br>
      And prey on garbage. <br>
      But soft! methinks I scent the morning air.<br>
      Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,<br>
      My custom always of the afternoon,<br>
      Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,<br>
      With juice of cursed hebona in a vial, <br>
      And in the porches of my ears did pour<br>
      The leperous distilment; whose effect<br>
      Holds such an enmity with blood of man<br>
      That swift as quicksilver it courses through<br>
      The natural gates and alleys of the body,<br>
      And with a sudden vigour it doth posset<br>
      And curd, like eager droppings into milk,<br>
      The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;<br>
      And a most instant tetter bark'd about,<br>
      Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust<br>
      All my smooth body.<br>
      Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand<br>
      Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd;<br>
      Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,<br>
      Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd, <br>
      No reckoning made, but sent to my account<br>
      With all my imperfections on my head. <br><br>

    <del><B>Hamlet.</b> O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible! </b></del><br><br>

     <b>Father's Ghost.</b> If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.<br>
      Let not the royal bed of Denmark be <br>
      A couch for luxury and damned incest.<br>
      But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,<br>
      Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive<br>
      Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven,<br>
      And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge <br>
      To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.<br>
      The glowworm shows the matin to be near<br>
      And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.<br>
      Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me. <br><br>
