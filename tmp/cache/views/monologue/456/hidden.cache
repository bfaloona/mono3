          O God of battles! steel my soldiers' hearts;<br>
Possess them not with fear; take from them now <br>
The sense of reckoning, if the opposed numbers<br>
Pluck their hearts from them. Not to-day, O Lord,<br>
O, not to-day, think not upon the fault<br>
My father made in compassing the crown!<br>
I Richard's body have interred anew; <br>
And on it have bestow'd more contrite tears<br>
Than from it issued forced drops of blood:<br>
Five hundred poor I have in yearly pay,<br>
Who twice a-day their wither'd hands hold up<br>
Toward heaven, to pardon blood; and I have built <br>
Two chantries, where the sad and solemn priests<br>
Sing still for Richard's soul. More will I do;<br>
Though all that I can do is nothing worth,<br>
Since that my penitence comes after all,<br>
Imploring pardon.
