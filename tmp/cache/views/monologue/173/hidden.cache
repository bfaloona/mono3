<i>[Opening the leaden casket]</i><br>
Fair Portia's counterfeit! What demi-god<br>
Hath come so near creation? Move these eyes?<br>
Or whether, riding on the balls of mine,<br>
Seem they in motion? Here are sever'd lips,<br>
Parted with sugar breath: so sweet a bar<br>
Should sunder such sweet friends. Here in her hairs<br>
The painter plays the spider and hath woven<br>
A golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men,<br>
Faster than gnats in cobwebs; but her eyes,--<br>
How could he see to do them? having made one,<br>
Methinks it should have power to steal both his<br>
And leave itself unfurnish'd. Yet look, how far<br>
The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow<br>
In underprizing it, so far this shadow<br>
Doth limp behind the substance. Here's the scroll,<br>
The continent and summary of my fortune.<br>
<i>[Reads]</i><br>
You that choose not by the view,<br>
Chance as fair and choose as true!<br>
Since this fortune falls to you,<br>
Be content and seek no new,<br>
If you be well pleased with this <br>
And hold your fortune for your bliss,<br>
Turn you where your lady is<br>
And claim her with a loving kiss.<br>
A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave;<br>
I come by note, to give and to receive.<br>
Like one of two contending in a prize,<br>
That thinks he hath done well in people's eyes,<br>
Hearing applause and universal shout,<br>
Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt<br>
Whether these pearls of praise be his or no; <br>
So, thrice fair lady, stand I, even so;<br>
As doubtful whether what I see be true,<br>
Until confirm'd, sign'd, ratified by you.
