          O Agamemnon, let it not be so!<br>
We'll consecrate the steps that Ajax makes <br>
When they go from Achilles: shall the proud lord<br>
That bastes his arrogance with his own seam<br>
And never suffers matter of the world<br>
Enter his thoughts, save such as do revolve<br>
And ruminate himself, shall he be worshipp'd <br>
Of that we hold an idol more than he?<br>
No, this thrice worthy and right valiant lord<br>
Must not so stale his palm, nobly acquired;<br>
Nor, by my will, assubjugate his merit,<br>
As amply titled as Achilles is, <br>
By going to Achilles:<br>
That were to enlard his fat already pride<br>
And add more coals to Cancer when he burns<br>
With entertaining great Hyperion.<br>
This lord go to him! Jupiter forbid, <br>
And say in thunder 'Achilles go to him.'
