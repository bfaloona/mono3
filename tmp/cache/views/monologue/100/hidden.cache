          Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange, and frown:<br>	 
Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects, <br>
I am not Adriana, nor thy wife. <br>
The time was once when thou unurg'd wouldst vow<br> 
That never words were music to thine ear, <br>
That never object pleasing in thine eye, <br>
That never touch well welcome to thy hand, <br>
That never meat sweet-savour'd in thy taste, <br>
Unless I spake, or look'd, or touch'd, or carv'd to thee.<br> 
How comes it now, my husband, O! how comes it, <br>
That thou art thus estranged from thyself?  <br>
Thyself I call it, being strange to me,<br> 
That, undividable, incorporate, <br>
Am better than thy dear self's better part.<br> 
Ah! do not tear away thyself from me, <br>
For know, my love, as easy mayst thou fall <br>
A drop of water in the breaking gulf,  <br>
And take unmingled thence that drop again, <br>
Without addition or diminishing,<br>
As take from me thyself and not me too. <br>
How dearly would it touch thee to the quick, <br>
Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious,<br> 
And that this body, consecrate to thee,<br>
By ruffian lust should be contaminate! <br>
Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me,<br> 
And hurl the name of husband in my face,  <br>
And tear the stain'd skin off my harlot-brow,<br>
And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring <br>
And break it with a deep-divorcing vow? <br>
I know thou canst; and therefore, see thou do it.<br> 
I am possess'd with an adulterate blot;<br>
My blood is mingled with the crime of lust: <br>
For if we two be one and thou play false, <br>
I do digest the poison of thy flesh, <br>
Being strumpeted by thy contagion.<br>
Keep then fair league and truce with thy true bed;<br> 
I live unstain'd, thou undishonoured.
