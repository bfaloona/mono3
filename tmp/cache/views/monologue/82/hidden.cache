          Hel.<br> 
That you may well perceive I have not wrong'd you,<br>	 
One of the greatest in the Christian world  <br>
Shall be my surety; 'fore whose throne 'tis needful,<br> 
Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel. <br>
Time was I did him a desired office, <br>
Dear almost as his life; which gratitude <br>
Through flinty Tartar's bosom would peep forth,<br> 
And answer, thanks. I duly am inform'd <br>
His Grace is at Marseilles; to which place <br>
We have convenient convoy. You must know, <br>
I am supposed dead: the army breaking, <br>
My husband hies him home; where, heaven aiding,<br> 
And by the leave of my good lord the king, <br>
We'll be before our welcome. <p>
<font size='-1' style='text-decoration: line-through;'>
Wid.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gentle madam, <br>
You never had a servant to whose trust<br> 
Your business was more welcome.</font> <p>
  Hel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor you, mistress, 
Ever a friend whose thoughts more truly labour<br> 
To recompense your love. Doubt not but heaven <br>
Hath brought me up to be your daughter's dower, <br>
As it hath fated her to be my motive <br>
And helper to a husband. But, O strange men!<br> 
That can such sweet use make of what they hate,<br> 
When saucy trusting of the cozen'd thoughts <br>
Defiles the pitchy night: so lust doth play  <br>
With what it loathes for that which is away.   <br>
But more of this hereafter. You, Diana, <br>
Under my poor instructions yet must suffer <br>
Something in my behalf. <p>

<font size='-1' style='text-decoration: line-through;'>
Dia.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let death and honesty<br> 
Go with your impositions, I am yours <br>
Upon your will to suffer.  </font><p>
  Hel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, I pray you: <br>
But with the word the time will bring on summer,<br>
When briers shall have leaves as well as thorns,  <br>
And be as sweet as sharp. We must away; <br>
Our waggon is prepar'd, and time revives us:<br>
All's well that ends well: still the fine's the crown;<br> 
Whate'er the course, the end is the renown.
