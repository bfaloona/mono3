           But yesterday the word of Caesar might<br>
Have stood against the world; now lies he there.<br>
And none so poor to do him reverence. <br>
O masters, if I were disposed to stir<br>
Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,<br>
I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,<br>
Who, you all know, are honourable men:<br>
I will not do them wrong; I rather choose <br>
To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,<br>
Than I will wrong such honourable men.<br>
But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar;<br>
I found it in his closet, 'tis his will:<br>
Let but the commons hear this testamentâ€” <br>
Which, pardon me, I do not mean to readâ€”<br>
And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds<br>
And dip their napkins in his sacred blood,<br>
Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,<br>
And, dying, mention it within their wills,<br>
Bequeathing it as a rich legacy<br>
Unto their issue.
