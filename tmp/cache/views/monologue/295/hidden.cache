There is a kind of character in thy life,<br>
That to the observer doth thy history <br>
Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings<br>
Are not thine own so proper as to waste<br>
Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.<br>
Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,<br>
Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues<br>
Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike<br>
As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'd<br>
But to fine issues, nor Nature never lends<br>
The smallest scruple of her excellence<br>
But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines<br>
Herself the glory of a creditor,<br>
Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech<br>
To one that can my part in him advertise;<br>
Hold therefore, Angelo:â€”<br>
In our remove be thou at full ourself;<br>
Mortality and mercy in Vienna<br>
Live in thy tongue and heart: old Escalus,<br>
Though first in question, is thy secondary.<br>
Take thy commission.
