          O hateful hands, to tear such loving words!<br>
Injurious wasps, to feed on such sweet honey <br>
And kill the bees that yield it with your stings!<br>
I'll kiss each several paper for amends.<br>
Look, here is writ 'kind Julia.' Unkind Julia!<br>
As in revenge of thy ingratitude,<br>
I throw thy name against the bruising stones,<br>
Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain.<br>
And here is writ 'love-wounded Proteus.'<br>
Poor wounded name! my bosom as a bed<br>
Shall lodge thee till thy wound be thoroughly heal'd;<br>
And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss. <br>
But twice or thrice was 'Proteus' written down.<br>
Be calm, good wind, blow not a word away<br>
Till I have found each letter in the letter,<br>
Except mine own name: that some whirlwind bear<br>
Unto a ragged fearful-hanging rock <br>
And throw it thence into the raging sea!<br>
Lo, here in one line is his name twice writ,<br>
'Poor forlorn Proteus, passionate Proteus,<br>
To the sweet Julia:' that I'll tear away.<br>
And yet I will not, sith so prettily <br>
He couples it to his complaining names.<br>
Thus will I fold them one on another:<br>
Now kiss, embrace, contend, do what you will.
