          <div align=right>Ay, marry, is't;</div>
But to my mind, though I am native here<br>
And to the manner born, it is a custom<br>
More honour'd in the breach than the observance.<br>
This heavy-headed revel east and west <br>
Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations;<br>
They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase<br>
Soil our addition; and indeed it takes<br>
From our achievements, though perform'd at height,<br>
The pith and marrow of our attribute. <br>
So oft it chances in particular men<br>
That, for some vicious mole of nature in them,<br>
As in their birth,- wherein they are not guilty,<br>
Since nature cannot choose his origin,-<br>
By the o'ergrowth of some complexion, <br>
Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,<br>
Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens<br>
The form of plausive manners, that these men<br>
Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,<br>
Being nature's livery, or fortune's star, <br>
Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace,<br>
As infinite as man may undergo-<br>
Shall in the general censure take corruption<br>
From that particular fault. The dram of e'il<br>
Doth all the noble substance often dout To his own scandal. <br>
