      <div class="monologue_preview">
          I, that please some, try all, both joy and terror<br>
Of good and bad, that makes and unfolds error,<br>
Now take upon me, in the name of Time, <br>
To use my wings. Impute it not a crime<br>
To me or my swift passage, that I slide<br>
O'er sixteen years and leave the growth untried<br>
Of that wide gap, since it is in my power<br>
To o'erthrow law and in one self-born hour <br>
To plant and o'erwhelm custom. Let me pass<br>
The same I am, ere ancient'st order was<br>
Or what is now received: I witness to<br>
The times that brought them in; so shall I do<br>
To the freshest things now reigning and make stale <br>
The glistering of this present, as my tale<br>
Now seems to it. Your patience this allowing,<br>
I turn my glass and give my scene such growing<br>
As you had slept between: Leontes leaving,<br>
The effects of his fond jealousies so grieving <br>
That he shuts up himself, imagine me,<br>
Gentle spectators, that I now may be<br>
In fair Bohemia, and remember well,<br>
I mentioned a son o' the king's, which Florizel<br>
I now name to you; and with speed so pace <br>
To speak of Perdita, now grown in grace<br>
Equal with wondering: what of her ensues<br>
I list not prophecy; but let Time's news<br>
Be known when 'tis brought forth. A shepherd's daughter, <br>
And what to her adheres, which follows after,<br>
Is the argument of Time. Of this allow,<br>
If ever you have spent time worse ere now;<br>
If never, yet that Time himself doth say<br>
He wishes earnestly you never may.
