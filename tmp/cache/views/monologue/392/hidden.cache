          You understand me not that tell me so:<br>
I do not speak of flight, of fear, of death, <br>
But dare all imminence that gods and men<br>
Address their dangers in. Hector is gone:<br>
Who shall tell Priam so, or Hecuba?<br>
Let him that will a screech-owl aye be call'd,<br>
Go in to Troy, and say there, Hector's dead: <br>
There is a word will Priam turn to stone;<br>
Make wells and Niobes of the maids and wives,<br>
Cold statues of the youth, and, in a word,<br>
Scare Troy out of itself. But, march away:<br>
Hector is dead; there is no more to say. <br>
Stay yet. You vile abominable tents,<br>
Thus proudly pight upon our Phrygian plains,<br>
Let Titan rise as early as he dare,<br>
I'll through and through you! and, thou great-sized coward,<br>
No space of earth shall sunder our two hates: <br>
I'll haunt thee like a wicked conscience still,<br>
That mouldeth goblins swift as frenzy's thoughts.<br>
Strike a free march to Troy! with comfort go:<br>
Hope of revenge shall hide our inward woe.
