          I know thee not, old man. Fall to thy prayers.<br>
How ill white hairs become a fool and jester!<br>
I have long dreamt of such a kind of man,<br>
So surfeit-swell'd, so old, and so profane;<br>
But being awak'd, I do despise my dream.<br>
Make less thy body hence, and more thy grace; <br>
Leave gormandizing; know the grave doth gape<br>
For thee thrice wider than for other menâ€”<br>
Reply not to me with a fool-born jest;<br>
Presume not that I am the thing I was,<br>
For God doth know, so shall the world perceive,<br>
That I have turn'd away my former self;<br>
So will I those that kept me company.<br>
When thou dost hear I am as I have been,<br>
Approach me, and thou shalt be as thou wast,<br>
The tutor and the feeder of my riots. <br>
Till then I banish thee, on pain of death,<br>
As I have done the rest of my misleaders,<br>
Not to come near our person by ten mile.<br>
For competence of life I will allow you,<br>
That lack of means enforce you not to evils; <br>
And, as we hear you do reform yourselves,<br>
We will, according to your strengths and qualities,<br>
Give you advancement. Be it your charge, my lord,<br>
To see perform'd the tenour of our word.<br>
Set on. <i>[Exeunt the KING and his train]</i>
