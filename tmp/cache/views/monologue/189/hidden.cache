          No shame but mine; I must, forsooth, be forc'd<br>
To give my hand, oppos'd against my heart,<br>
Unto a mad-brain rudesby, full of spleen,<br>
Who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure.<br>
I told you, I, he was a frantic fool,<br>
Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behaviour;<br>
And, to be noted for a merry man,<br>
He'll woo a thousand, 'point the day of marriage,<br>
Make friends invited, and proclaim the banns;<br>
Yet never means to wed where he hath woo'd.<br>
Now must the world point at poor Katherine,<br>
And say 'Lo, there is mad Petruchio's wife,<br>
If it would please him come and marry her!'
