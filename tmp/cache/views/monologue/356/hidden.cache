          All the infections that the sun sucks up<br>
From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall and make him<br>
By inch-meal a disease! His spirits hear me<br>
And yet I needs must curse. But they'll nor pinch, <br>
Fright me with urchinâ€”shows, pitch me i' the mire,<br>
Nor lead me, like a firebrand, in the dark<br>
Out of my way, unless he bid 'em; but<br>
For every trifle are they set upon me;<br>
Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me <br>
And after bite me, then like hedgehogs which<br>
Lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount<br>
Their pricks at my footfall; sometime am I<br>
All wound with adders who with cloven tongues<br>
Do hiss me into madness. <br>
