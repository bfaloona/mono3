My learned lord, we pray you to proceed<br>
And justly and religiously unfold <br>
Why the law Salique that they have in France<br>
Or should, or should not, bar us in our claim:<br>
And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,<br>
That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,<br>
Or nicely charge your understanding soul <br>
With opening titles miscreate, whose right<br>
Suits not in native colours with the truth;<br>
For God doth know how many now in health<br>
Shall drop their blood in approbation<br>
Of what your reverence shall incite us to. <br>
Therefore take heed how you impawn our person,<br>
How you awake our sleeping sword of war:<br>
We charge you, in the name of God, take heed;<br>
For never two such kingdoms did contend<br>
Without much fall of blood; whose guiltless drops <br>
Are every one a woe, a sore complaint<br>
'Gainst him whose wrong gives edge unto the swords<br>
That make such waste in brief mortality.<br>
Under this conjuration, speak, my lord;<br>
For we will hear, note and believe in heart <br>
That what you speak is in your conscience wash'd<br>
As pure as sin with baptism.
