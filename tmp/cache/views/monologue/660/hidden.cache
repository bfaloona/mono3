          <div align=right>Behold, I have a weapon;</div>
A better never did itself sustain<br>
Upon a soldier's thigh: I have seen the day,<br>
That, with this little arm and this good sword,<br>
I have made my way through more impediments <br>
Than twenty times your stop: but, O vain boast!<br>
Who can control his fate? 'tis not so now.<br>
Be not afraid, though you do see me weapon'd;<br>
Here is my journey's end, here is my butt,<br>
And very sea-mark of my utmost sail. <br>
Do you go back dismay'd? 'tis a lost fear;<br>
Man but a rush against Othello's breast,<br>
And he retires. Where should Othello go?<br>
Now, how dost thou look now? O ill-starr'd wench!<br>
Pale as thy smock! when we shall meet at compt, <br>
This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,<br>
And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl!<br>
Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!<br>
Whip me, ye devils,<br>
From the possession of this heavenly sight! <br>
Blow me about in winds! roast me in sulphur!<br>
Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!<br>
O Desdemona! Desdemona! dead!<br>
Oh! Oh! Oh! <br>
