      <div class="monologue_preview">
          God pardon thee! yet let me wonder, Harry,<br>
At thy affections, which do hold a wing<br>
Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors.<br>
Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost.<br>
Which by thy younger brother is supplied,<br>
And art almost an alien to the hearts<br>
Of all the court and princes of my blood:<br>
The hope and expectation of thy time<br>
Is ruin'd, and the soul of every man <br>
Prophetically doth forethink thy fall.<br>
Had I so lavish of my presence been,<br>
So common-hackney'd in the eyes of men,<br>
So stale and cheap to vulgar company,<br>
Opinion, that did help me to the crown,<br>
Had still kept loyal to possession<br>
And left me in reputeless banishment,<br>
A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.<br>
By being seldom seen, I could not stir<br>
But like a comet I was wonder'd at;<br>
That men would tell their children 'This is he;'<br>
Others would say 'Where, which is Bolingbroke?'<br>
And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,<br>
And dress'd myself in such humility<br>
That I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts, <br>
Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths,<br>
Even in the presence of the crowned king.<br>
Thus did I keep my person fresh and new;<br>
My presence, like a robe pontifical,<br>
Ne'er seen but wonder'd at: and so my state,<br>
Seldom but sumptuous, showed like a feast<br>
And won by rareness such solemnity.<br>
The skipping king, he ambled up and down<br>
With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits,<br>
Soon kindled and soon burnt; carded his state,<br>
Mingled his royalty with capering fools,<br>
Had his great name profaned with their scorns<br>
And gave his countenance, against his name,<br>
To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push<br>
Of every beardless vain comparative,<br>
Grew a companion to the common streets,<br>
Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;<br>
That, being daily swallow'd by men's eyes,<br>
They surfeited with honey and began<br>
To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little <br>
More than a little is by much too much.<br>
So when he had occasion to be seen,<br>
He was but as the cuckoo is in June,<br>
Heard, not regarded; seen, but with such eyes<br>
As, sick and blunted with community, <br>
Afford no extraordinary gaze,<br>
Such as is bent on sun-like majesty<br>
When it shines seldom in admiring eyes;<br>
But rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down,<br>
Slept in his face and render'd such aspect <br>
As cloudy men use to their adversaries,<br>
Being with his presence glutted, gorged and full.<br>
And in that very line, Harry, standest thou;<br>
For thou has lost thy princely privilege<br>
With vile participation: not an eye<br>
But is a-weary of thy common sight,<br>
Save mine, which hath desired to see thee more;<br>
Which now doth that I would not have it do,<br>
Make blind itself with foolish tenderness.
