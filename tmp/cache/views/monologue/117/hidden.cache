          I false! Thy conscience witness! Iachimo,<br>
Thou didst accuse him of incontinency;  <br>
Thou then look'dst like a villain; now methinks <br>
Thy favour's good enough. Some jay of Italy, <br>
Whose mother was her painting, hath betray'd him:<br> 
Poor I am stale, a garment out of fashion,  <br>
And, for I am richer than to hang by the walls, <br>
I must be ripp'd; to pieces with me! O! <br>
Men's vows are women's traitors! All good seeming,<br> 
By thy revolt, O husband! shall be thought <br> 48
Put on for villany; not born where 't grows, <br>
But worn a bait for ladies. <br>
  <del>Pisanio -        Good madam, hear me.</del> <br>
True honest men being heard, like false &#198;neas,<br>
Were in his time thought false, and Sinon's weeping <br>
Did scandal many a holy tear, took pity <br>
From most true wretchedness; so thou, Posthumus,<br> 
Wilt lay the leaven on all proper men;  <br>
Goodly and gallant shall be false and perjur'd<br> 
From thy great fail. Come, fellow, be thou honest;<br> 
Do thou thy master's bidding. When thou seest him,  <br>
A little witness my obedience; look! <br>
I draw the sword myself; take it, and hit <br>
The innocent mansion of my love, my heart. <br>
Fear not, 'tis empty of all things but grief; <br>
Thy master is not there, who was indeed  <br>
The riches of it: do his bidding; strike. <br>
Thou mayst be valiant in a better cause, <br>
But now thou seem'st a coward.<br>
