          O Lord, sir, 'tis a deed of policy: <br>
Shall she live to betray this guilt of ours,<br>
A long-tongued babbling gossip? no, lords, no:<br>
And now be it known to you my full intent.<br>
Not far, one Muli lives, my countryman;<br>
His wife but yesternight was brought to bed; <br>
His child is like to her, fair as you are:<br>
Go pack with him, and give the mother gold,<br>
And tell them both the circumstance of all;<br>
And how by this their child shall be advanced,<br>
And be received for the emperor's heir, <br>
And substituted in the place of mine,<br>
To calm this tempest whirling in the court;<br>
And let the emperor dandle him for his own.<br>
Hark ye, lords; ye see I have given her physic,<br>
<i>[Pointing to the nurse]</i> <br>
And you must needs bestow her funeral;<br>
The fields are near, and you are gallant grooms:<br>
This done, see that you take no longer days,<br>
But send the midwife presently to me.<br>
The midwife and the nurse well made away, <br>
Then let the ladies tattle what they please.
