          O, reason not the need! Our basest beggars <br>
Are in the poorest thing superfluous.<br>
Allow not nature more than nature needs,<br>
Man's life is cheap as beast's. Thou art a lady:<br>
If only to go warm were gorgeous,<br>
Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st <br>
Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need-<br>
You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!<br>
You see me here, you gods, a poor old man,<br>
As full of grief as age; wretched in both.<br>
If it be you that stirs these daughters' hearts <br>
Against their father, fool me not so much<br>
To bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger,<br>
And let not women's weapons, water drops,<br>
Stain my man's cheeks! No, you unnatural hags!<br>
I will have such revenges on you both <br>
That all the world shall- I will do such things-<br>
What they are yet, I know not; but they shall be<br>
The terrors of the earth! You think I'll weep.<br>
No, I'll not weep.<br>
I have full cause of weeping, but this heart <br>
Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws<br>
Or ere I'll weep. O fool, I shall go mad!
