          My liege, I am advised what I say:<br>
Neither disturb'd with the effect of wine,<br> 
Nor heady-rash, provok'd with raging ire, <br>
Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad. <br>
This woman lock'd me out this day from dinner:<br>
That goldsmith there, were he not pack'd with her, <br>
Could witness it, for he was with me then; <br>
Who parted with me to go fetch a chain, <br>
Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,<br>
Where Balthazar and I did dine together.  <br>
Our dinner done, and he not coming thither, <br>
I went to seek him: in the street I met him, <br>
And in his company that gentleman.<br>
There did this perjur'd goldsmith swear me down<br> 
That I this day of him receiv'd the chain,  <br>
Which, God he knows, I saw not; for the which <br>
He did arrest me with an officer.<br>
I did obey, and sent my peasant home <br>
For certain ducats: he with none return'd.<br> 
Then fairly I bespoke the officer <br>
To go in person with me to my house.<br>
By the way we met <br>
My wife, her sister, and a rabble more <br>
Of vile confederates: along with them <br>
They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-fac'd villain,<br>
A mere anatomy, a mountebank, <br>
A threadbare juggler, and a fortune-teller,<br>
A needy, hollow-ey'd, sharp-looking wretch,  <br>
A living-dead man. This pernicious slave,<br>
Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer, <br>
And, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,<br>
And with no face, as 'twere, out-facing me,  <br>
Cries out, I was possess'd. Then, altogether <br>
They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence,  <br>
And in a dark and dankish vault at home <br>
There left me and my man, both bound together;<br>
Till, gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,<br>
I gain'd my freedom, and immediately  <br>
Ran hither to your Grace; whom I beseech <br>
To give me ample satisfaction <br>
For these deep shames and great indignities.<br>
