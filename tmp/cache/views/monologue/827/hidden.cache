          But I do think it is their husbands' faults<br>
If wives do fall: say that they slack their duties,<br>
And pour our treasures into foreign laps,<br>
Or else break out in peevish jealousies,<br>
Throwing restraint upon us; or say they strike us,<br>
Or scant our former having in despite;<br>
Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace,<br>
Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know<br>
Their wives have sense like them: they see and smell<br>
And have their palates both for sweet and sour,<br>
As husbands have. What is it that they do<br>
When they change us for others? Is it sport? <br>
I think it is: and doth affection breed it?<br>
I think it doth: is't frailty that thus errs?<br>
It is so too: and have not we affections,<br>
Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?<br>
Then let them use us well: else let them know, <br>
The ills we do, their ills instruct us so. <br>
