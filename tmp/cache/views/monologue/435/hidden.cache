           O for a Muse of fire, that would ascend<br>
The brightest heaven of invention,<br>
A kingdom for a stage, princes to act<br>
And monarchs to behold the swelling scene!<br>
Then should the warlike Harry, like himself,<br>
Assume the port of Mars; and at his heels,<br>
Leash'd in like hounds, should famine, sword and fire<br>
Crouch for employment. But pardon, and gentles all,<br>
The flat unraised spirits that have dared <br>
On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth<br>
So great an object: can this cockpit hold<br>
The vasty fields of France? or may we cram<br>
Within this wooden O the very casques<br>
That did affright the air at Agincourt? <br>
O, pardon! since a crooked figure may<br>
Attest in little place a million;<br>
And let us, ciphers to this great accompt,<br>
On your imaginary forces work.<br>
Suppose within the girdle of these walls<br>
Are now confined two mighty monarchies,<br>
Whose high upreared and abutting fronts<br>
The perilous narrow ocean parts asunder:<br>
Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts;<br>
Into a thousand parts divide on man, <br>
And make imaginary puissance;<br>
Think when we talk of horses, that you see them<br>
Printing their proud hoofs i' the receiving earth;<br>
For 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings,<br>
Carry them here and there; jumping o'er times, <br>
Turning the accomplishment of many years<br>
Into an hour-glass: for the which supply,<br>
Admit me Chorus to this history;<br>
Who prologue-like your humble patience pray,<br>
Gently to hear, kindly to judge, our play.
