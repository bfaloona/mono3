          Revolted Mortimer!<br>
He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,<br>
But by the chance of war; to prove that true <br>
Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds,<br>
Those mouthed wounds, which valiantly he took<br>
When on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank,<br>
In single opposition, hand to hand,<br>
He did confound the best part of an hour<br>
In changing hardiment with great Glendower:<br>
Three times they breathed and three times did they drink,<br>
Upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood;<br>
Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks,<br>
Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds,<br>
And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,<br>
Bloodstained with these valiant combatants.<br>
Never did base and rotten policy<br>
Colour her working with such deadly wounds;<br>
Nor could the noble Mortimer<br>
Receive so many, and all willingly:<br>
Then let not him be slander'd with revolt.
