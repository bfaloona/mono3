          That I did love the Moor to live with him,<br>
My downright violence and storm of fortunes<br>
May trumpet to the world: my heart's subdued<br>
Even to the very quality of my lord:<br>
I saw Othello's visage in his mind,<br>
And to his honour and his valiant parts<br>
Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate.<br>
So that, dear lords, if I be left behind,<br>
A moth of peace, and he go to the war,<br>
The rites for which I love him are bereft me,<br>
And I a heavy interim shall support <br>
By his dear absence. Let me go with him.<br>
