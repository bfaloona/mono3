          To leave my Julia, shall I be forsworn;<br>
To love fair Silvia, shall I be forsworn;<br>
To wrong my friend, I shall be much forsworn;<br>
And even that power which gave me first my oath<br>
Provokes me to this threefold perjury; <br>
Love bade me swear and Love bids me forswear.<br>
O sweet-suggesting Love, if thou hast sinned,<br>
Teach me, thy tempted subject, to excuse it!<br>
At first I did adore a twinkling star,<br>
But now I worship a celestial sun. <br>
Unheedful vows may heedfully be broken,<br>
And he wants wit that wants resolved will<br>
To learn his wit to exchange the bad for better.<br>
Fie, fie, unreverend tongue! to call her bad,<br>
Whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferr'd <br>
With twenty thousand soul-confirming oaths.<br>
I cannot leave to love, and yet I do;<br>
But there I leave to love where I should love.<br>
Julia I lose and Valentine I lose:<br>
If I keep them, I needs must lose myself; <br>
If I lose them, thus find I by their loss<br>
For Valentine myself, for Julia Silvia.<br>
I to myself am dearer than a friend,<br>
For love is still most precious in itself;<br>
And Silvia—witness Heaven, that made her fair!— <br>
Shows Julia but a swarthy Ethiope.<br>
I will forget that Julia is alive,<br>
Remembering that my love to her is dead;<br>
And Valentine I'll hold an enemy,<br>
Aiming at Silvia as a sweeter friend. <br>
I cannot now prove constant to myself,<br>
Without some treachery used to Valentine.<br>
This night he meaneth with a corded ladder<br>
To climb celestial Silvia's chamber-window,<br>
Myself in counsel, his competitor. <br>
Now presently I'll give her father notice<br>
Of their disguising and pretended flight;<br>
Who, all enraged, will banish Valentine;<br>
For Thurio, he intends, shall wed his daughter;<br>
But, Valentine being gone, I'll quickly cross <br>
By some sly trick blunt Thurio's dull proceeding.<br>
Love, lend me wings to make my purpose swift,<br>
As thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift!
