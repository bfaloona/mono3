      <div class="monologue_preview">
          This is the air; that is the glorious sun;<br>
This pearl she gave me, I do feel't and see't;<br>
And though 'tis wonder that enwraps me thus,<br>
Yet 'tis not madness. Where's Antonio, then? <br>
I could not find him at the Elephant:<br>
Yet there he was; and there I found this credit,<br>
That he did range the town to seek me out.<br>
His counsel now might do me golden service;<br>
For though my soul disputes well with my sense,<br>
That this may be some error, but no madness,<br>
Yet doth this accident and flood of fortune<br>
So far exceed all instance, all discourse,<br>
That I am ready to distrust mine eyes<br>
And wrangle with my reason that persuades me <br>
To any other trust but that I am mad<br>
Or else the lady's mad; yet, if 'twere so,<br>
She could not sway her house, command her followers,<br>
Take and give back affairs and their dispatch<br>
With such a smooth, discreet and stable bearing<br>
As I perceive she does: there's something in't<br>
That is deceiveable. But here the lady comes.
