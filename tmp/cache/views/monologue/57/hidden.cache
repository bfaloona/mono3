          My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth,<br>
Of this their purpose hither to this wood;<br>
And I in fury hither follow'd them, <br>
Fair Helena in fancy following me.<br>
But, my good lord, I wot not by what power,.<br>
But by some power it is,.my love to Hermia,<br>
Melted as the snow, seems to me now<br>
As the remembrance of an idle gaud <br>
Which in my childhood I did dote upon;<br>
And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,<br>
The object and the pleasure of mine eye,<br>
Is only Helena. To her, my lord,<br>
Was I betroth'd ere I saw Hermia: <br>
But, like in sickness, did I loathe this food;<br>
But, as in health, come to my natural taste,<br>
Now I do wish it, love it, long for it,<br>
And will for evermore be true to it.
