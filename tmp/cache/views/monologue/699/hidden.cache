           Come, Marcus; come, kinsmen; this is the way.<br>
Sir boy, now let me see your archery;<br>
Look ye draw home enough, and 'tis there straight.<br>
Terras Astraea reliquit: <br>
Be you remember'd, Marcus, she's gone, she's fled.<br>
Sirs, take you to your tools. You, cousins, shall<br>
Go sound the ocean, and cast your nets;<br>
Happily you may catch her in the sea;<br>
Yet there's as little justice as at land: <br>
No; Publius and Sempronius, you must do it;<br>
'Tis you must dig with mattock and with spade,<br>
And pierce the inmost centre of the earth:<br>
Then, when you come to Pluto's region,<br>
I pray you, deliver him this petition; <br>
Tell him, it is for justice and for aid,<br>
And that it comes from old Andronicus,<br>
Shaken with sorrows in ungrateful Rome.<br>
Ah, Rome! Well, well; I made thee miserable<br>
What time I threw the people's suffrages<br>
On him that thus doth tyrannize o'er me.<br>
Go, get you gone; and pray be careful all,<br>
And leave you not a man-of-war unsearch'd:<br>
This wicked emperor may have shipp'd her hence;<br>
And, kinsmen, then we may go pipe for justice.
