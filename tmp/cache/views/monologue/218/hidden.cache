      <div class="monologue_preview">
          I know you all, and will awhile uphold<br>
The unyoked humour of your idleness:<br>
Yet herein will I imitate the sun, <br>
Who doth permit the base contagious clouds<br>
To smother up his beauty from the world,<br>
That, when he please again to be himself,<br>
Being wanted, he may be more wonder'd at,<br>
By breaking through the foul and ugly mists<br>
Of vapours that did seem to strangle him.<br>
If all the year were playing holidays,<br>
To sport would be as tedious as to work;<br>
But when they seldom come, they wish'd for come,<br>
And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents. <br>
So, when this loose behavior I throw off<br>
And pay the debt I never promised,<br>
By how much better than my word I am,<br>
By so much shall I falsify men's hopes;<br>
And like bright metal on a sullen ground, <br>
My reformation, glittering o'er my fault,<br>
Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes<br>
Than that which hath no foil to set it off.<br>
I'll so offend, to make offence a skill;<br>
Redeeming time when men think least I will.
