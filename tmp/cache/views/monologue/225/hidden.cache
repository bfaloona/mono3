          <b>Falstaff.</b> Peace, good pint-pot; peace, good tickle-brain.<br>
      Harry, I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy<br>
      time, but also how thou art accompanied: for though<br>
      the camomile, the more it is trodden on the faster<br>
      it grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted the<br>
      sooner it wears. That thou art my son, I have<br>
      partly thy mother's word, partly my own opinion,<br>
      but chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye and a<br>
      foolish-hanging of thy nether lip, that doth warrant<br>
      me. If then thou be son to me, here lies the point;<br>
      why, being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall<br>
      the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat<br>
      blackberries? a question not to be asked. Shall<br>
      the sun of England prove a thief and take purses? a<br>
      question to be asked. There is a thing, Harry,<br>
      which thou hast often heard of and it is known to<br>
      many in our land by the name of pitch: this pitch,<br>
      as ancient writers do report, doth defile; so doth<br>
      the company thou keepest: for, Harry, now I do not<br>
      speak to thee in drink but in tears, not in<br>
      pleasure but in passion, not in words only, but in<br>
      woes also: and yet there is a virtuous man whom I<br>
      have often noted in thy company, but I know not his name. <br><br>

<del><b>Henry V.</b> What manner of man, an it like your majesty?</del><br><br>

<b>Falstaff.</b> A goodly portly man, i' faith, and a corpulent; of a
      cheerful look, a pleasing eye and a most noble<br>
      carriage; and, as I think, his age some fifty, or,<br>
      by'r lady, inclining to three score; and now I<br>
      remember me, his name is Falstaff: if that man<br>
      should be lewdly given, he deceiveth me; for, Harry,<br>
      I see virtue in his looks. If then the tree may be<br>
      known by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, then,<br>
      peremptorily I speak it, there is virtue in that<br>
      Falstaff: him keep with, the rest banish. And tell<br>
      me now, thou naughty varlet, tell me, where hast<br>
      thou been this month?<br><br>

<del><b>Henry V.</b> Dost thou speak like a king? Do thou stand for me,
      and I'll play my father.</del> <br><br>

<b>Falstaff.</b> Depose me? if thou dost it half so gravely, so<br>
      majestically, both in word and matter, hang me up by<br>
      the heels for a rabbit-sucker or a poulter's hare.
