          <div align="right">For all the world</div>
As thou art to this hour was Richard then<br>
When I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh,<br>
And even as I was then is Percy now. <br>
Now, by my sceptre and my soul to boot,<br>
He hath more worthy interest to the state<br>
Than thou the shadow of succession;<br>
For of no right, nor colour like to right,<br>
He doth fill fields with harness in the realm, <br>
Turns head against the lion's armed jaws,<br>
And, being no more in debt to years than thou,<br>
Leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on<br>
To bloody battles and to bruising arms.<br>
What never-dying honour hath he got<br>
Against renowned Douglas! whose high deeds,<br>
Whose hot incursions and great name in arms<br>
Holds from all soldiers chief majority<br>
And military title capital<br>
Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ:<br>
Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathling clothes,<br>
This infant warrior, in his enterprises<br>
Discomfited great Douglas, ta'en him once,<br>
Enlarged him and made a friend of him,<br>
To fill the mouth of deep defiance up <br>
And shake the peace and safety of our throne.<br>
And what say you to this? Percy, Northumberland,<br>
The Archbishop's grace of York, Douglas, Mortimer,<br>
Capitulate against us and are up.<br>
But wherefore do I tell these news to thee?<br>
Why, Harry, do I tell thee of my foes,<br>
Which art my near'st and dearest enemy?<br>
Thou that art like enough, through vassal fear,<br>
Base inclination and the start of spleen<br>
To fight against me under Percy's pay, <br>
To dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns,<br>
To show how much thou art degenerate.
