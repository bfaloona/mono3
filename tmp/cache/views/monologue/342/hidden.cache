          Thou speak'st like a physician, Helicanus,<br>
That minister'st a potion unto me<br>
That thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself.<br>
Attend me, then: I went to Antioch,<br>
Where as thou know'st, against the face of death,<br>
I sought the purchase of a glorious beauty.<br>
From whence an issue I might propagate,<br>
Are arms to princes, and bring joys to subjects.<br>
Her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder;<br>
The restâ€”hark in thine earâ€”as black as incest: <br>
Which by my knowledge found, the sinful father<br>
Seem'd not to strike, but smooth: but thou know'st this,<br>
'Tis time to fear when tyrants seem to kiss.<br>
Such fear so grew in me, I hither fled, <br>
Under the covering of a careful night,<br>
Who seem'd my good protector; and, being here,<br>
Bethought me what was past, what might succeed.<br>
I knew him tyrannous; and tyrants' fears<br>
Decrease not, but grow faster than the years: <br>
And should he doubt it, as no doubt he doth,<br>
That I should open to the listening air<br>
How many worthy princes' bloods were shed,<br>
To keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope,<br>
To lop that doubt, he'll fill this land with arms,<br>
And make pretence of wrong that I have done him:<br>
When all, for mine, if I may call offence,<br>
Must feel war's blow, who spares not innocence:<br>
Which love to all, of which thyself art one,<br>
Who now reprovest me for it,â€”
