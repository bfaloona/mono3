          Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,<br>
To cut the head off and then hack the limbs,<br>
Like wrath in death and envy afterwards;<br>
For Antony is but a limb of Caesar: <br>
Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.<br>
We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar;<br>
And in the spirit of men there is no blood:<br>
O, that we then could come by Caesar's spirit,<br>
And not dismember Caesar! But, alas, <br>
Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,<br>
Let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;<br>
Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,<br>
Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds:<br>
And let our hearts, as subtle masters do, <br>
Stir up their servants to an act of rage,<br>
And after seem to chide 'em. This shall make<br>
Our purpose necessary and not envious:<br>
Which so appearing to the common eyes,<br>
We shall be call'd purgers, not murderers. <br>
And for Mark Antony, think not of him;<br>
For he can do no more than Caesar's arm<br>
When Caesar's head is off.
