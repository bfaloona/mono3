          <div align="right">Why should this change of thoughts,</div>
The sad companion, dull-eyed melancholy,<br>
Be my so used a guest as not an hour,<br>
In the day's glorious walk, or peaceful night, <br>
The tomb where grief should sleep, can breed me quiet?<br>
Here pleasures court mine eyes, and mine eyes shun them,<br>
And danger, which I fear'd, is at Antioch,<br>
Whose aim seems far too short to hit me here:<br>
Yet neither pleasure's art can joy my spirits, <br>
Nor yet the other's distance comfort me.<br>
Then it is thus: the passions of the mind,<br>
That have their first conception by mis-dread,<br>
Have after-nourishment and life by care;<br>
And what was first but fear what might be done,<br>
Grows elder now and cares it be not done.<br>
And so with me: the great Antiochus,<br>
'Gainst whom I am too little to contend,<br>
Since he's so great can make his will his act,<br>
Will think me speaking, though I swear to silence;<br>
Nor boots it me to say I honour him.<br>
If he suspect I may dishonour him:<br>
And what may make him blush in being known,<br>
He'll stop the course by which it might be known;<br>
With hostile forces he'll o'erspread the land, <br>
And with the ostent of war will look so huge,<br>
Amazement shall drive courage from the state;<br>
Our men be vanquish'd ere they do resist,<br>
And subjects punish'd that ne'er thought offence:<br>
Which care of them, not pity of myself, <br>
Who am no more but as the tops of trees,<br>
Which fence the roots they grow by and defend them,<br>
Makes both my body pine and soul to languish,<br>
And punish that before that he would punish.
