          How! of adultery! Wherefore write you not <br>	 
What monster's her accuser? Leonatus!    <br>
O master! what a strange infection <br>
Is fall'n into thy ear! What false Italian. <br>
As poisonous-tongu'd as handed'hath prevail'd <br>
On thy too ready hearing? Disloyal! No:   <br>
She's punish'd for her truth, and undergoes, <br>
More goddess-like than wife-like, such assaults <br>
As would take in some virtue. O my master! <br>
Thy mind to her is now as low as were  <br>
Thy fortunes. How! that I should murder her?<br> 
Upon the love and truth and vows which I <br>
Have made to thy command? I, her? her blood? <br>
If it be so to do good service, never   <br>
Let me be counted serviceable. How look I, <br>
That I should seem to lack humanity <br>
So much as this fact comes to?'Do 't: the letter<br> 
That I have sent her by her own command  <br>
Shall give thee opportunity:'O damn'd paper! <br>
Black as the ink that's on thee. Senseless bauble,<br> 
Art thou a feodary for this act, and look'st <br>
So virgin-like without? Lo! here she comes.  
I am ignorant in what I am commanded.<br>
