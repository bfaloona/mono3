          Who? thy lord? that is my lord, Leonatus.	 <br>
O! learn'd indeed were that astronomer <br>
That knew the stars as I his characters; <br>
He'd lay the future open. You good gods,  <br>
Let what is here contain'd relish of love,  <br>
Of my lord's health, of his content, yet not <br>
That we two are asunder; let that grieve him,-- <br>
Some griefs are med'cinable; that is one of them, <br>
For it doth physic love,--of his content,  <br>
All but in that! Good wax, thy leave. Bless'd be<br> 
You bees that make these locks of counsel! Lovers <br>
And men in dangerous bonds pray not alike;  <br>
Though forfeiters you cast in prison, yet <br>
You clasp young Cupid's tables. Good news, gods!<p> 
<i>Justice, and your father's wrath, should he take me in his dominion, could not be so cruel to me, as you, O the dearest of creatures, would not even renew me with your eyes. Take notice that I am in Cambria, at Milford-Haven; what your own love will out of this advise you, follow. So, he wishes you all happiness, that remains loyal to his vow, and your, increasing in love,  LEONATUS POSTHUMUS.</i> <p>
O! for a horse with wings! Hear'st thou, Pisanio? <br>
He is at Milford-Haven; read, and tell me <br>
How far 'tis thither. If one of mean affairs <br>
May plod it in a week, why may not I  <br>
Glide thither in a day? Then, true Pisanio,--<br>
Who long'st, like me, to see thy lord; who long'st,-- <br>
O! let me 'bate,--but not like me; yet long'st, <br>
But in a fainter kind:--O! not like me, <br>
For mine's beyond beyond; say, and speak thick;--<br>
Love's counsellor should fill the bores of hearing, <br>
To the smothering of the sense,--how far it is <br>
To this same blessed Milford; and, by the way, <br>
Tell me how Wales was made so happy as <br>
T' inherit such a haven; but, first of all, <br>
How we may steal from hence, and, for the gap <br>
That we shall make in time, from our hencegoing <br>
And our return, to excuse; but first, how get hence.<br>
Why should excuse be born or ere begot? <br>
We'll talk of that hereafter. Prithee, speak,<br> 
How many score of miles may we well ride <br>
'Twixt hour and hour?<br>
