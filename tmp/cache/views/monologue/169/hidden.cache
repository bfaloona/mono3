              <b>Prince of Arragon.</b> <br>
      And so have I address'd me. Fortune now<br>
      To my heart's hope! Gold; silver; and base lead.<br>
      'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.' <br>
      You shall look fairer, ere I give or hazard.<br>
      What says the golden chest? ha! let me see:<br>
      'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'<br>
      What many men desire! that 'many' may be meant<br>
      By the fool multitude, that choose by show,<br>
      Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;<br>
      Which pries not to the interior, but, like the martlet,<br>
      Builds in the weather on the outward wall,<br>
      Even in the force and road of casualty.<br>
      I will not choose what many men desire,<br>
      Because I will not jump with common spirits<br>
      And rank me with the barbarous multitudes.<br>
      Why, then to thee, thou silver treasure-house;<br>
      Tell me once more what title thou dost bear:
      'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves:'<br>
      And well said too; for who shall go about<br>
      To cozen fortune and be honourable<br>
      Without the stamp of merit? Let none presume<br>
      To wear an undeserved dignity.<br>
      O, that estates, degrees and offices<br>
      Were not derived corruptly, and that clear honour<br>
      Were purchased by the merit of the wearer!<br>
      How many then should cover that stand bare!<br>
      How many be commanded that command!<br>
      How much low peasantry would then be glean'd <br>
      From the true seed of honour! and how much honour<br>
      Pick'd from the chaff and ruin of the times<br>
      To be new-varnish'd! Well, but to my choice:<br>
      'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'<br>
      I will assume desert. Give me a key for this,<br>
      And instantly unlock my fortunes here. <br><br>

<i> [He opens the silver casket]</i><br><br>

    <del><b>Portia.</b> Too long a pause for that which you find there.</del><br><br> 

    <b>Prince of Arragon.</b><br> 
    What's here? the portrait of a blinking idiot,<br>
      Presenting me a schedule! I will read it. <br>
      How much unlike art thou to Portia!<br>
      How much unlike my hopes and my deservings!<br>
      'Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves.'<br>
      Did I deserve no more than a fool's head?<br>
      Is that my prize? are my deserts no better?
