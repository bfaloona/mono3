          Cease to lament for that thou canst not help, <br>
And study help for that which thou lament'st.<br>
Time is the nurse and breeder of all good.<br>
Here if thou stay, thou canst not see thy love;<br>
Besides, thy staying will abridge thy life.<br>
Hope is a lover's staff; walk hence with that <br>
And manage it against despairing thoughts.<br>
Thy letters may be here, though thou art hence;<br>
Which, being writ to me, shall be deliver'd<br>
Even in the milk-white bosom of thy love.<br>
The time now serves not to expostulate: <br>
Come, I'll convey thee through the city-gate;<br>
And, ere I part with thee, confer at large<br>
Of all that may concern thy love-affairs.<br>
As thou lovest Silvia, though not for thyself,<br>
Regard thy danger, and along with me!
