One of my sex; no woman's face remember,<br>
Save, from my glass, mine own; nor have I seen<br>
More that I may call men than you, good friend,<br>
And my dear father: how features are abroad,<br>
I am skilless of; but, by my modesty,<br>
The jewel in my dower, I would not wish<br>
Any companion in the world but you,<br>
Nor can imagination form a shape,<br>
Besides yourself, to like of. But I prattle <br>
Something too wildly and my father's precepts<br>
I therein do forget.
