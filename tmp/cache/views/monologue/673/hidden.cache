          Each man to his stool, with that spur as he would to <br>
the lip of his mistress: your diet shall be in all<br>
places alike. Make not a city feast of it, to let<br>
the meat cool ere we can agree upon the first place:<br>
sit, sit. The gods require our thanks.<br>
You great benefactors, sprinkle our society with <br>
thankfulness. For your own gifts, make yourselves<br>
praised: but reserve still to give, lest your<br>
deities be despised. Lend to each man enough, that<br>
one need not lend to another; for, were your<br>
godheads to borrow of men, men would forsake the <br>
gods. Make the meat be beloved more than the man<br>
that gives it. Let no assembly of twenty be without<br>
a score of villains: if there sit twelve women at<br>
the table, let a dozen of them beâ€”as they are. The<br>
rest of your fees, O godsâ€”the senators of Athens,<br>
together with the common lag of peopleâ€”what is<br>
amiss in them, you gods, make suitable for<br>
destruction. For these my present friends, as they<br>
are to me nothing, so in nothing bless them, and to<br>
nothing are they welcome. <br>
Uncover, dogs, and lap.<br>
