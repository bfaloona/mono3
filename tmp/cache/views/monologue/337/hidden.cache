          I do much wonder that one man, seeing how much 
another man is a fool when he dedicates his 
behaviors to love, will, after he hath laughed at 
such shallow follies in others, become the argument 
of his own scorn by failing in love: and such a man 
is Claudio. I have known when there was no music 
with him but the drum and the fife; and now had he 
rather hear the tabour and the pipe: I have known 
when he would have walked ten mile a-foot to see a 
good armour; and now will he lie ten nights awake,  
carving the fashion of a new doublet. He was wont to 
speak plain and to the purpose, like an honest man 
and a soldier; and now is he turned orthography; his 
words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many 
strange dishes. May I be so converted and see with  
these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not: I will not 
be sworn, but love may transform me to an oyster; but 
I'll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster 
of me, he shall never make me such a fool. One woman 
is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I am  
well; another virtuous, yet I am well; but till all 
graces be in one woman, one woman shall not come in 
my grace. Rich she shall be, that's certain; wise, 
or I'll none; virtuous, or I'll never cheapen her; 
fair, or I'll never look on her; mild, or come not  
near me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good 
discourse, an excellent musician, and her hair shall 
be of what colour it please God. Ha! the prince and 
Monsieur Love! I will hide me in the arbour.
