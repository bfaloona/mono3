      ass; though it be not written down, yet forget not
      that I am an ass. No, thou villain, thou art full of
      piety, as shall be proved upon thee by good witness.
      I am a wise fellow, and, which is more, an officer,
      and, which is more, a householder, and, which is
      more, as pretty a piece of flesh as any is in 
      Messina, and one that knows the law, go to; and a
      rich fellow enough, go to; and a fellow that hath
      had losses, and one that hath two gowns and every
      thing handsome about him. Bring him away. O that
      I had been writ down an ass!
