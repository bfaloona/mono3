          'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet, <br>
To give these mourning duties to your father;<br>
But you must know, your father lost a father;<br>
That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound<br>
In filial obligation for some term<br>
To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever<br>
In obstinate condolement is a course<br>
Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;<br>
It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,<br>
A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,<br>
An understanding simple and unschool'd; <br>
For what we know must be, and is as common<br>
As any the most vulgar thing to sense,<br>
Why should we in our peevish opposition<br>
Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,<br>
A fault against the dead, a fault to nature, <br>
To reason most absurd, whose common theme<br>
Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,<br>
From the first corse till he that died to-day,<br>
'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth<br>
This unprevailing woe, and think of us <br>
As of a father; for let the world take note<br>
You are the most immediate to our throne,<br>
And with no less nobility of love<br>
Than that which dearest father bears his son<br>
Do I impart toward you. For your intent <br>
In going back to school in Wittenberg,<br>
It is most retrograde to our desire;<br>
And we beseech you, bend you to remain<br>
Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,<br>
Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son. <br>
