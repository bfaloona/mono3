          Why, as I told thee, 'tis a custom with him,<br>
I' th' afternoon to sleep: there thou mayst brain him,<br>
Having first seized his books, or with a log<br>
Batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,<br>
Or cut his wezand with thy knife. Remember<br>
First to possess his books; for without them<br>
He's but a sot, as I am, nor hath not<br>
One spirit to command: they all do hate him<br>
As rootedly as I. Burn but his books. <br>
He has brave utensils,—for so he calls them—<br>
Which when he has a house, he'll deck withal<br>
And that most deeply to consider is<br>
The beauty of his daughter; he himself<br>
Calls her a nonpareil: I never saw a woman, <br>
But only Sycorax my dam and she;<br>
But she as far surpasseth Sycorax<br>
As great'st does least. <bR>
