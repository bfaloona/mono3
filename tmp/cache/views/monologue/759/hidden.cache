          How many women would do such a message?<br>
Alas, poor Proteus! thou hast entertain'd<br>
A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.<br>
Alas, poor fool! why do I pity him<br>
That with his very heart despiseth me?<br>
Because he loves her, he despiseth me;<br>
Because I love him I must pity him. <br>
This ring I gave him when he parted from me,<br>
To bind him to remember my good will;<br>
And now am I, unhappy messenger,<br>
To plead for that which I would not obtain,<br>
To carry that which I would have refused, <br>
To praise his faith which I would have dispraised.<br>
I am my master's true-confirmed love;<br>
But cannot be true servant to my master,<br>
Unless I prove false traitor to myself.<br>
Yet will I woo for him, but yet so coldly <br>
As, heaven it knows, I would not have him speed.<br>
<i>[Enter SILVIA, attended]</i><br>
Gentlewoman, good day! I pray you, be my mean<br>
To bring me where to speak with Madam Silvia.
