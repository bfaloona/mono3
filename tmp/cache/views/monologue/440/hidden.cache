          We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us;<br>
His present and your pains we thank you for: <br>
When we have march'd our rackets to these balls,<br>
We will, in France, by God's grace, play a set<br>
Shall strike his father's crown into the hazard.<br>
Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler<br>
That all the courts of France will be disturb'd <br>
With chaces. And we understand him well,<br>
How he comes o'er us with our wilder days,<br>
Not measuring what use we made of them.<br>
We never valued this poor seat of England;<br>
And therefore, living hence, did give ourself <br>
To barbarous licence; as 'tis ever common<br>
That men are merriest when they are from home.<br>
But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state,<br>
Be like a king and show my sail of greatness<br>
When I do rouse me in my throne of France: <br>
For that I have laid by my majesty<br>
And plodded like a man for working-days,<br>
But I will rise there with so full a glory<br>
That I will dazzle all the eyes of France,<br>
Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us. <br>
And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his<br>
Hath turn'd his balls to gun-stones; and his soul<br>
Shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance<br>
That shall fly with them: for many a thousand widows<br>
Shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands; <br>
Mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down;<br>
And some are yet ungotten and unborn<br>
That shall have cause to curse the Dauphin's scorn.<br>
But this lies all within the will of God,<br>
To whom I do appeal; and in whose name <br>
Tell you the Dauphin I am coming on,<br>
To venge me as I may and to put forth<br>
My rightful hand in a well-hallow'd cause.<br>
So get you hence in peace; and tell the Dauphin<br>
His jest will savour but of shallow wit,<br>
When thousands weep more than did laugh at it.<br>
Convey them with safe conduct. Fare you well.
