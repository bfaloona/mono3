          O that this too too solid flesh would melt,<br>
Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!<br>
Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd <br>
His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!<br>
How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable<br>
Seem to me all the uses of this world!<br>
Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden<br>
That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature <br>
Possess it merely. That it should come to this!<br>
But two months dead! Nay, not so much, not two.<br>
So excellent a king, that was to this<br>
Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother<br>
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven<br>
Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!<br>
Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him<br>
As if increase of appetite had grown<br>
By what it fed on; and yet, within a month-<br>
Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman!- <br>
A little month, or ere those shoes were old<br>
With which she followed my poor father's body<br>
Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she<br>
(O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason<br>
Would have mourn'd longer) married with my uncle;<br>
My father's brother, but no more like my father<br>
Than I to Hercules. Within a month,<br>
Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears<br>
Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,<br>
She married. O, most wicked speed, to post<br>
With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!<br>
It is not, nor it cannot come to good.<br>
But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue! <br>
