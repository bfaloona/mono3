          Consider, sir, the chance of war: the day<br>
Was yours by accident; had it gone with us,<br>
We should not, when the blood was cool, 
have threaten'd<br>
Our prisoners with the sword. But since the gods<br>
Will have it thus, that nothing but our lives<br>
May be call'd ransom, let it come: sufficeth<br>
A Roman with a Roman's heart can suffer: <br>
Augustus lives to think on't: and so much<br>
For my peculiar care. This one thing only<br>
I will entreat; my boy, a Briton born,<br>
Let him be ransom'd: never master had<br>
A page so kind, so duteous, diligent,<br>
So tender over his occasions, true,<br>
So feat, so nurse-like: let his virtue join<br>
With my request, which I make bold your highness<br>
Cannot deny; he hath done no Briton harm,<br>
Though he have served a Roman: save him, sir,<br>
And spare no blood beside. <br>
