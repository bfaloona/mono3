          So many journeys may the sun and moon<br>
Make us again count o'er ere love be done!<br>
But woe is me! you are so sick of late,<br>
So far from cheer and from your former state.<br>
That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,<br>
Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must;<br>
For women's fear and love holds quantity,<br>
In neither aught, or in extremity.<br>
Now what my love is, proof hath made you know;<br>
And as my love is siz'd, my fear is so.<br>
Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;<br>
Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
