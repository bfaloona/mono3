          That Cassio loves her, I do well believe it;<br>
That she loves him, 'tis apt and of great credit:<br>
The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not,<br>
Is of a constant, loving, noble nature, <br>
And I dare think he'll prove to Desdemona<br>
A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too;<br>
Not out of absolute lust, though peradventure<br>
I stand accountant for as great a sin,<br>
But partly led to diet my revenge, <br>
For that I do suspect the lusty Moor<br>
Hath leap'd into my seat; the thought whereof<br>
Doth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards;<br>
And nothing can or shall content my soul<br>
Till I am even'd with him, wife for wife, <br>
Or failing so, yet that I put the Moor<br>
At least into a jealousy so strong<br>
That judgment cannot cure. Which thing to do,<br>
If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trash<br>
For his quick hunting, stand the putting on, <br>
I'll have our Michael Cassio on the hip,<br>
Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb—<br>
For I fear Cassio with my night-cap too—<br>
Make the Moor thank me, love me and reward me.<br>
For making him egregiously an ass <br>
And practising upon his peace and quiet<br>
Even to madness. 'Tis here, but yet confused:<br>
Knavery's plain face is never seen tin used. <br>
