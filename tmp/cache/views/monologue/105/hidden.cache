          Merchant of Syracusa, plead no more. <br>
I am not partial to infringe our laws:	 <br> 
The enmity and discord which of late <br>
Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke<br>
To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen, <br>
Who, wanting guilders to redeem their lives, <br>
Have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods, <br>
Excludes all pity from our threat'ning looks. <br>
For, since the mortal and intestine jars <br>
'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us, <br>
It hath in solemn synods been decreed, <br>
Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,  <br>
T' admit no traffic to our adverse towns: <br>
Nay, more, if any, born at Ephesus  <br>
Be seen at Syracusian marts and fairs; <br>
Again, if any Syracusian born <br>
Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies, <br>
His goods confiscate to the duke's dispose; <br>
Unless a thousand marks be levied,  <br>
To quit the penalty and to ransom him. <br>
Thy substance, valu'd at the highest rate, <br>
Cannot amount unto a hundred marks; <br>
Therefore, by law thou art condemn'd to die.
