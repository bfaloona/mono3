          <b>Apemantus.</b> This is in thee a nature but infected;<br>
 A poor unmanly melancholy sprung<br>
 From change of fortune. Why this spade? this place?<br>
 This slave-like habit? and these looks of care?<br>
 Thy flatterers yet wear silk, drink wine, lie soft;<br>
 Hug their diseased perfumes, and have forgot <br>
 That ever Timon was. Shame not these woods,<br>
 By putting on the cunning of a carper.<br>
 Be thou a flatterer now, and seek to thrive<br>
 By that which has undone thee: hinge thy knee,<br>
 And let his very breath, whom thou'lt observe, <br>
 Blow off thy cap; praise his most vicious strain,<br>
 And call it excellent: thou wast told thus;<br>
 Thou gavest thine ears like tapsters that bid welcome<br>
 To knaves and all approachers: 'tis most just<br>
 That thou turn rascal; hadst thou wealth again,<br>
 Rascals should have 't. Do not assume my likeness. <br>
<br>
<del><b>Timon.</b> Were I like thee, I'ld throw away myself. </del><br>
<br>
<b>Apemantus.</b> Thou hast cast away thyself, being like thyself;<br>
 A madman so long, now a fool. What, think'st<br>
 That the bleak air, thy boisterous chamberlain,<br>
 Will put thy shirt on warm? will these moss'd trees,<br>
 That have outlived the eagle, page thy heels,<br>
 And skip where thou point'st out? will the cold brook,<br>
 Candied with ice, caudle thy morning taste, <br>
 To cure thy o'er-night's surfeit? Call the creatures<br>
 Whose naked natures live in an the spite<br>
 Of wreakful heaven, whose bare unhoused trunks,<br>
 To the conflicting elements exposed,<br>
 Answer mere nature; bid them flatter thee;
