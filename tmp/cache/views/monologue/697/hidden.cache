          So, so; now sit: and look you eat no more <br>
Than will preserve just so much strength in us<br>
As will revenge these bitter woes of ours.<br>
Marcus, unknit that sorrow-wreathen knot:<br>
Thy niece and I, poor creatures, want our hands,<br>
And cannot passionate our tenfold grief <br>
With folded arms. This poor right hand of mine<br>
Is left to tyrannize upon my breast;<br>
Who, when my heart, all mad with misery,<br>
Beats in this hollow prison of my flesh,<br>
Then thus I thump it down. <br>
<i>[To LAVINIA]</i><br>
Thou map of woe, that thus dost talk in signs!<br>
When thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating,<br>
Thou canst not strike it thus to make it still.<br>
Wound it with sighing, girl, kill it with groans; 1460<br>
Or get some little knife between thy teeth,<br>
And just against thy heart make thou a hole;<br>
That all the tears that thy poor eyes let fall<br>
May run into that sink, and soaking in<br>
Drown the lamenting fool in sea-salt tears.
