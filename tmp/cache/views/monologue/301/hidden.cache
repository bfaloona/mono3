           When I would pray and think, I think and pray<br>
To several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words;<br>
Whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue,<br>
Anchors on Isabel: Heaven in my mouth, <br>
As if I did but only chew his name;<br>
And in my heart the strong and swelling evil<br>
Of my conception. The state, whereon I studied<br>
Is like a good thing, being often read,<br>
Grown fear'd and tedious; yea, my gravity,<br>
Wherein—let no man hear me—I take pride,<br>
Could I with boot change for an idle plume,<br>
Which the air beats for vain. O place, O form,<br>
How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,<br>
Wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls<br>
To thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood:<br>
Let's write good angel on the devil's horn:<br>
'Tis not the devil's crest. <br>
