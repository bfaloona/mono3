          The king doth keep his revels here to-night: <br>
Take heed the queen come not within his sight;<br>
For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,<br>
Because that she as her attendant hath<br>
A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king;<br>
She never had so sweet a changeling; <br>
And jealous Oberon would have the child<br>
Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;<br>
But she perforce withholds the loved boy,<br>
Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy:<br>
And now they never meet in grove or green, <br>
By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,<br>
But, they do square, that all their elves for fear<br>
Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there.
