          If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well<br>
It were done quickly: if the assassination<br>
Could trammel up the consequence, and catch<br>
With his surcease success; that but this blow<br>
Might be the be-all and the end-all here,<br>
But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,<br>
We'ld jump the life to come. But in these cases <br>
We still have judgment here; that we but teach<br>
Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return<br>
To plague the inventor: this even-handed justice<br>
Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice<br>
To our own lips. He's here in double trust;<br>
First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,<br>
Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,<br>
Who should against his murderer shut the door,<br>
Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan<br>
Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been <br>
So clear in his great office, that his virtues<br>
Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against<br>
The deep damnation of his taking-off;<br>
And pity, like a naked new-born babe,<br>
Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, horsed <br>
Upon the sightless couriers of the air,<br>
Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,<br>
That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur<br>
To prick the sides of my intent, but only<br>
Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself <br>
And falls on the other.
