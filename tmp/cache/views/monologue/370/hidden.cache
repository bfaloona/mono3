      <div class="monologue_preview">
          With due observance of thy godlike seat,<br>
Great Agamemnon, Nestor shall apply<br>
Thy latest words. In the reproof of chance<br>
Lies the true proof of men: the sea being smooth,<br>
How many shallow bauble boats dare sail<br>
Upon her patient breast, making their way<br>
With those of nobler bulk!<br>
But let the ruffian Boreas once enrage<br>
The gentle Thetis, and anon behold<br>
The strong-ribb'd bark through liquid mountains cut, <br>
Bounding between the two moist elements,<br>
Like Perseus' horse: where's then the saucy boat<br>
Whose weak untimber'd sides but even now<br>
Co-rivall'd greatness? Either to harbour fled,<br>
Or made a toast for Neptune. Even so <br>
Doth valour's show and valour's worth divide<br>
In storms of fortune; for in her ray and brightness<br>
The herd hath more annoyance by the breeze<br>
Than by the tiger; but when the splitting wind<br>
Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks, <br>
And flies fled under shade, why, then the thing of courage<br>
As roused with rage with rage doth sympathize,<br>
And with an accent tuned in selfsame key<br>
Retorts to chiding fortune.
