           This is the point.<br>
The duke is very strangely gone from hence;<br>
Bore many gentlemen, myself being one, <br>
In hand and hope of action: but we do learn<br>
By those that know the very nerves of state,<br>
His givings-out were of an infinite distance<br>
From his true-meant design. Upon his place,<br>
And with full line of his authority, <br>
Governs Lord Angelo; a man whose blood<br>
Is very snow-broth; one who never feels<br>
The wanton stings and motions of the sense,<br>
But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge<br>
With profits of the mind, study and fast. <br>
He—to give fear to use and liberty,<br>
Which have for long run by the hideous law,<br>
As mice by lions—hath pick'd out an act,<br>
Under whose heavy sense your brother's life<br>
Falls into forfeit: he arrests him on it; <br>
And follows close the rigour of the statute,<br>
To make him an example. All hope is gone,<br>
Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer<br>
To soften Angelo: and that's my pith of business<br>
'Twixt you and your poor brother. <br>
