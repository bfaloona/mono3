      <div class="monologue_preview">
          Her father loved me; oft invited me;<br>
Still question'd me the story of my life,<br>
From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes, <br>
That I have passed.<br>
I ran it through, even from my boyish days,<br>
To the very moment that he bade me tell it;<br>
Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,<br>
Of moving accidents by flood and field <br>
Of hair-breadth scapes i' the imminent deadly breach,<br>
Of being taken by the insolent foe<br>
And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence<br>
And portance in my travels' history:<br>
Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,<br>
Rough quarries, rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven<br>
It was my hint to speak,â€”such was the process;<br>
And of the Cannibals that each other eat,<br>
The Anthropophagi and men whose heads<br>
Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear <br>
Would Desdemona seriously incline:<br>
But still the house-affairs would draw her thence:<br>
Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,<br>
She'ld come again, and with a greedy ear<br>
Devour up my discourse: which I observing, <br>
Took once a pliant hour, and found good means<br>
To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart<br>
That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,<br>
Whereof by parcels she had something heard,<br>
But not intentively: I did consent, <br>
And often did beguile her of her tears,<br>
When I did speak of some distressful stroke<br>
That my youth suffer'd. My story being done,<br>
She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:<br>
She swore, in faith, twas strange, 'twas passing strange, <br>
'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful:<br>
She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd<br>
That heaven had made her such a man: she thank'd me,<br>
And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,<br>
I should but teach him how to tell my story. <br>
And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:<br>
She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd,<br>
And I loved her that she did pity them.<br>
This only is the witchcraft I have used:<br>
Here comes the lady; let her witness it. <br>
