          To your own bents dispose you: you'll be found,<br>
Be you beneath the sky. Aside] I am angling now,<br>
Though you perceive me not how I give line.<br>
Go to, go to!<br>
How she holds up the neb, the bill to him! <br>
And arms her with the boldness of a wife<br>
To her allowing husband!<br>
[Exeunt POLIXENES, HERMIONE, and Attendants]<br>
Gone already!<br>
Inch-thick, knee-deep, o'er head and ears a fork'd one!<br>
Go, play, boy, play: thy mother plays, and I<br>
Play too, but so disgraced a part, whose issue<br>
Will hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamour<br>
Will be my knell. Go, play, boy, play. There have been,<br>
Or I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now;<br>
And many a man there is, even at this present,<br>
Now while I speak this, holds his wife by the arm,<br>
That little thinks she has been sluiced in's absence<br>
And his pond fish'd by his next neighbour, by<br>
Sir Smile, his neighbour: nay, there's comfort in't<br>
Whiles other men have gates and those gates open'd,<br>
As mine, against their will. Should all despair<br>
That have revolted wives, the tenth of mankind <br>
Would hang themselves. Physic for't there is none;<br>
It is a bawdy planet, that will strike<br>
Where 'tis predominant; and 'tis powerful, think it,<br>
From east, west, north and south: be it concluded,<br>
No barricado for a belly; know't; <br>
It will let in and out the enemy<br>
With bag and baggage: many thousand on's<br>
Have the disease, and feel't not. How now, boy!
