          Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes and groves,<br>
And ye that on the sands with printless foot <br>
Do chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him<br>
When he comes back; you demi-puppets that<br>
By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,<br>
Whereof the ewe not bites, and you whose pastime<br>
Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice <br>
To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid,<br>
Weak masters though ye be, I have bedimm'd<br>
The noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds,<br>
And 'twixt the green sea and the azured vault<br>
Set roaring war: to the dread rattling thunder<br>
Have I given fire and rifted Jove's stout oak<br>
With his own bolt; the strong-based promontory<br>
Have I made shake and by the spurs pluck'd up<br>
The pine and cedar: graves at my command<br>
Have waked their sleepers, oped, and let 'em forth <br>
By my so potent art. But this rough magic<br>
I here abjure, and, when I have required<br>
Some heavenly music, which even now I do,<br>
To work mine end upon their senses that<br>
This airy charm is for, I'll break my staff, <br>
Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,<br>
And deeper than did ever plummet sound<br>
I'll drown my book. <br>
