          Sirrah, go you to Barthol'mew my page,<br>
And see him dress'd in all suits like a lady;<br>
That done, conduct him to the drunkard's chamber,<br>
And call him 'madam,' do him obeisance.<br>
Tell him from me- as he will win my love-<br>
He bear himself with honourable action,<br>
Such as he hath observ'd in noble ladies<br>
Unto their lords, by them accomplished;<br>
Such duty to the drunkard let him do,<br>

With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,<br>
And say 'What is't your honour will command,<br>
Wherein your lady and your humble wife<br>
May show her duty and make known her love?' <br>
And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses,<br>
And with declining head into his bosom,<br>
Bid him shed tears, as being overjoyed<br>
To see her noble lord restor'd to health,<br>
Who for this seven years hath esteemed him <br>

No better than a poor and loathsome beggar.<br>
And if the boy have not a woman's gift<br>
To rain a shower of commanded tears,<br>
An onion will do well for such a shift,<br>
Which, in a napkin being close convey'd,<br>
Shall in despite enforce a watery eye.<br>
See this dispatch'd with all the haste thou canst;<br>
Anon I'll give thee more instructions.<br> 
<i>[Exit a SERVINGMAN]</i><br>

I know the boy will well usurp the grace,<br>
Voice, gait, and action, of a gentlewoman;<br>
I long to hear him call the drunkard 'husband';<br>
And how my men will stay themselves from laughter<br>
When they do homage to this simple peasant.<br>
I'll in to counsel them; haply my presence<br>
May well abate the over-merry spleen, <br>
Which otherwise would grow into extremes. <br>
<i>[Exeunt]</i>
