          I pray you, tarry: pause a day or two<br>
Before you hazard; for, in choosing wrong,<br>
I lose your company: therefore forbear awhile.<br>
There's something tells me, but it is not love,<br>
I would not lose you; and you know yourself,<br>
Hate counsels not in such a quality.<br>
But lest you should not understand me well,--<br>
And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought,--<br>
I would detain you here some month or two<br>
Before you venture for me. I could teach you<br>
How to choose right, but I am then forsworn;<br>
So will I never be: so may you miss me; <br>
But if you do, you'll make me wish a sin,<br>
That I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes,<br>
They have o'erlook'd me and divided me;<br>
One half of me is yours, the other half yours,<br>
Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours, <br>
And so all yours. O, these naughty times<br>
Put bars between the owners and their rights!<br>
And so, though yours, not yours. Prove it so,<br>
Let fortune go to hell for it, not I.<br>
I speak too long; but 'tis to peize the time,<br>
To eke it and to draw it out in length,<br>
To stay you from election. <br>
