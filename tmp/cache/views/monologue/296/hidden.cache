          <b>Claudio.</b> Thus stands it with me: upon a true contract<br>
 I got possession of Julietta's bed:<br>
 You know the lady; she is fast my wife,<br>
 Save that we do the denunciation lack<br>
 Of outward order: this we came not to, <br>
 Only for propagation of a dower<br>
 Remaining in the coffer of her friends,<br>
 From whom we thought it meet to hide our love<br>
 Till time had made them for us. But it chances<br>
 The stealth of our most mutual entertainment<br>
 With character too gross is writ on Juliet. <br>
<br>
<del><b> Lucio.</b> With child, perhaps? </del><br>
<br>
<b>Claudio.</b> Unhappily, even so.<br>
 And the new deputy now for the duke—<br>
 Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,<br>
 Or whether that the body public be<br>
 A horse whereon the governor doth ride,<br>
 Who, newly in the seat, that it may know<br>
 He can command, lets it straight feel the spur;<br>
 Whether the tyranny be in his place, <br>
 Or in his emmence that fills it up,<br>
 I stagger in:—but this new governor<br>
 Awakes me all the enrolled penalties<br>
 Which have, like unscour'd armour, hung by the wall<br>
 So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round <br>
 And none of them been worn; and, for a name,<br>
 Now puts the drowsy and neglected act<br>
 Freshly on me: 'tis surely for a name.
