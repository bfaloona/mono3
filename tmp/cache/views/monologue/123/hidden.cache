      <div class="monologue_preview">
          Is there no way for men to be, but women <br>	 
Must be half-workers? We are all bastards; all,<br>
And that most venerable man which I <br>
Did call my father was I know not where <br>
When I was stamp'd; some coiner with his tools<br> 
Made me a counterfeit; yet my mother seem'd   <br>
The Dian of that time; so doth my wife <br>
The nonpareil of this. O! vengeance, vengeance; <br> 
Me of my lawful pleasure she restrain'd <br>
And pray'd me oft forbearance; did it with  <br>
A pudency so rosy the sweet view on 't <br>
Might well have warm'd old Saturn; that I thought her <br> 
As chaste as unsunn'd snow. O! all the devils! <br>
This yellow Iachimo, in an hour,'was 't not?  <br>
Or less'at first?'perchance he spoke not, but  <br>
Like a full-acorn'd boar, a German one, <br>
Cried 'O!' and mounted; found no opposition <br>
But what he look'd for should oppose and she <br>
Should from encounter guard. Could I find out  <br>
The woman's part in me! For there's no motion   <br>
That tends to vice in man but I affirm  <br>
It is the woman's part; be it lying, note it,
The woman's; flattering, hers; deceiving, hers; <br>
Lust and rank thoughts, hers, hers; revenges, hers; <br>
Ambitions, covetings, change of prides, disdain, <br>
Nice longing, slanders, mutability,  <br>
All faults that man may name, nay, that hell knows,<br> 
Why, hers, in part, or all; but rather, all;  <br>
For even to vice <br>
They are not constant, but are changing still
One vice but of a minute old for one <br>
Not half so old as that. I'll write against them,<br> 
Detest them, curse them. Yet 'tis greater skill <br>
In a true hate to pray they have their will:  <br>
The very devils cannot plague them better.  [Exit.]<br>
