          They are worse fools to purchase mocking so.<br>
That same Biron I'll torture ere I go:<br>
O that I knew he were but in by the week!<br>
How I would make him fawn and beg and seek<br>
And wait the season and observe the times <br>
And spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes<br>
And shape his service wholly to my hests<br>
And make him proud to make me proud that jests!<br>
So perttaunt-like would I o'ersway his state<br>
That he should be my fool and I his fate.
