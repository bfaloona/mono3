          Who will believe thee, Isabel?<br>
My unsoil'd name, the austereness of my life,<br>
My vouch against you, and my place i' the state,<br>
Will so your accusation overweigh,<br>
That you shall stifle in your own report<br>
And smell of calumny. I have begun,<br>
And now I give my sensual race the rein:<br>
Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite;<br>
Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes,<br>
That banish what they sue for; redeem thy brother<br>
By yielding up thy body to my will;<br>
Or else he must not only die the death,<br>
But thy unkindness shall his death draw out<br>
To lingering sufferance. Answer me to-morrow,<br>
Or, by the affection that now guides me most,<br>
I'll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,<br>
Say what you can, my false o'erweighs your true.
