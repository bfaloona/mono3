          Who is this? my niece, that flies away so fast! <br>
Cousin, a word; where is your husband?<br>
If I do dream, would all my wealth would wake me!<br>
If I do wake, some planet strike me down,<br>
That I may slumber in eternal sleep!<br>
Speak, gentle niece, what stern ungentle hands <br>
Have lopp'd and hew'd and made thy body bare<br>
Of her two branches, those sweet ornaments,<br>
Whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in,<br>
And might not gain so great a happiness<br>
As have thy love? Why dost not speak to me? <br>
Alas, a crimson river of warm blood,<br>
Like to a bubbling fountain stirr'd with wind,<br>
Doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips,<br>
Coming and going with thy honey breath.<br>
But, sure, some Tereus hath deflowered thee,<br>
And, lest thou shouldst detect him, cut thy tongue.<br>
Ah, now thou turn'st away thy face for shame!<br>
And, notwithstanding all this loss of blood,<br>
As from a conduit with three issuing spouts,<br>
Yet do thy cheeks look red as Titan's face <br>
Blushing to be encountered with a cloud.<br>
Shall I speak for thee? shall I say 'tis so?<br>
O, that I knew thy heart; and knew the beast,<br>
That I might rail at him, to ease my mind!<br>
Sorrow concealed, like an oven stopp'd, <br>
Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is.<br>
Fair Philomela, she but lost her tongue,<br>
And in a tedious sampler sew'd her mind:<br>
But, lovely niece, that mean is cut from thee;<br>
A craftier Tereus, cousin, hast thou met,<br>
And he hath cut those pretty fingers off,<br>
That could have better sew'd than Philomel.<br>
O, had the monster seen those lily hands<br>
Tremble, like aspen-leaves, upon a lute,<br>
And make the silken strings delight to kiss them, <br>
He would not then have touch'd them for his life!<br>
Or, had he heard the heavenly harmony<br>
Which that sweet tongue hath made,<br>
He would have dropp'd his knife, and fell asleep<br>
As Cerberus at the Thracian poet's feet. <br>
Come, let us go, and make thy father blind;<br>
For such a sight will blind a father's eye:<br>
One hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads;<br>
What will whole months of tears thy father's eyes?<br>
Do not draw back, for we will mourn with thee <br>
O, could our mourning ease thy misery!
