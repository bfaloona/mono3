          <b>Aaron.</b> Indeed, I was their tutor to instruct them:<br>
 That codding spirit had they from their mother,<br>
 As sure a card as ever won the set; <br>
 That bloody mind, I think, they learn'd of me,<br>
 As true a dog as ever fought at head.<br>
 Well, let my deeds be witness of my worth.<br>
 I train'd thy brethren to that guileful hole<br>
 Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay: <br>
 I wrote the letter that thy father found<br>
 And hid the gold within the letter mention'd,<br>
 Confederate with the queen and her two sons:<br>
 And what not done, that thou hast cause to rue,<br>
 Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it? <br>
 I play'd the cheater for thy father's hand,<br>
 And, when I had it, drew myself apart<br>
 And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter:<br>
 I pry'd me through the crevice of a wall<br>
 When, for his hand, he had his two sons' heads; <br>
 Beheld his tears, and laugh'd so heartily,<br>
 That both mine eyes were rainy like to his :<br>
 And when I told the empress of this sport,<br>
 She swooned almost at my pleasing tale,<br>
 And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses. <br>
<br>
<del><b>First Goth.</b> What, canst thou say all this, and never blush? <br>
<br>
<b>Aaron.</b> Ay, like a black dog, as the saying is. <br>
<br>
<b>Lucius.</b> Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds?</del> <br>
<br>
<b>Aaron.</b> Ay, that I had not done a thousand more.<br>
 Even now I curse the dayâ€”and yet, I think,<br>
 Few come within the compass of my curse,â€”<br>
 Wherein I did not some notorious ill,<br>
 As kill a man, or else devise his death,<br>
 Ravish a maid, or plot the way to do it,<br>
 Accuse some innocent and forswear myself, <br>
 Set deadly enmity between two friends,<br>
 Make poor men's cattle break their necks;<br>
 Set fire on barns and hay-stacks in the night,<br>
 And bid the owners quench them with their tears.<br>
 Oft have I digg'd up dead men from their graves, <br>
 And set them upright at their dear friends' doors,<br>
 Even when their sorrows almost were forgot;<br>
 And on their skins, as on the bark of trees,<br>
 Have with my knife carved in Roman letters,<br>
 'Let not your sorrow die, though I am dead.' <br>
 Tut, I have done a thousand dreadful things<br>
 As willingly as one would kill a fly,<br>
 And nothing grieves me heartily indeed<br>
 But that I cannot do ten thousand more.
