I may be negligent, foolish and fearful;<br>
In every one of these no man is free,<br>
But that his negligence, his folly, fear,<br>
Among the infinite doings of the world,<br>
Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord, <br>
If ever I were wilful-negligent,<br>
It was my folly; if industriously<br>
I play'd the fool, it was my negligence,<br>
Not weighing well the end; if ever fearful<br>
To do a thing, where I the issue doubted, <br>
Where of the execution did cry out<br>
Against the non-performance, 'twas a fear<br>
Which oft infects the wisest: these, my lord,<br>
Are such allow'd infirmities that honesty<br>
Is never free of. But, beseech your grace, <br>
Be plainer with me; let me know my trespass<br>
By its own visage: if I then deny it,<br>
'Tis none of mine.
