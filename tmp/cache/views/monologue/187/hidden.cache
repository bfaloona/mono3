      <div class="monologue_preview">
          <div align='right'>I pray thee, cease thy counsel,</div>
Which falls into mine ears as profitless<br>
As water in a sieve: give not me counsel;<br>
Nor let no comforter delight mine ear<br>
But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine.<br>
Bring me a father that so loved his child,<br>
Whose joy of her is overwhelm'd like mine,<br>
And bid him speak of patience;<br>
Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine<br>
And let it answer every strain for strain, <br>
As thus for thus and such a grief for such,<br>
In every lineament, branch, shape, and form:<br>
If such a one will smile and stroke his beard,<br>
Bid sorrow wag, cry 'hem!' when he should groan,<br>
Patch grief with proverbs, make misfortune drunk<br>
With candle-wasters; bring him yet to me,<br>
And I of him will gather patience.<br>
But there is no such man: for, brother, men<br>
Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief<br>
Which they themselves not feel; but, tasting it,<br>
Their counsel turns to passion, which before<br>
Would give preceptial medicine to rage,<br>
Fetter strong madness in a silken thread,<br>
Charm ache with air and agony with words:<br>
No, no; 'tis all men's office to speak patience <br>
To those that wring under the load of sorrow,<br>
But no man's virtue nor sufficiency<br>
To be so moral when he shall endure<br>
The like himself. Therefore give me no counsel:<br>
My griefs cry louder than advertisement.
