          Nor on the beasts themselves, the birds, and fishes;<br>
You must eat men. Yet thanks I must you con<br>
That you are thieves profess'd, that you work not<br>
In holier shapes: for there is boundless theft <br>
In limited professions. Rascal thieves,<br>
Here's gold. Go, suck the subtle blood o' the grape,<br>
Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth,<br>
And so 'scape hanging: trust not the physician;<br>
His antidotes are poison, and he slays <br>
Moe than you rob: take wealth and lives together;<br>
Do villany, do, since you protest to do't,<br>
Like workmen. I'll example you with thievery.<br>
The sun's a thief, and with his great attraction<br>
Robs the vast sea: the moon's an arrant thief, <br>
And her pale fire she snatches from the sun:<br>
The sea's a thief, whose liquid surge resolves<br>
The moon into salt tears: the earth's a thief,<br>
That feeds and breeds by a composture stolen<br>
From general excrement: each thing's a thief: <br>
The laws, your curb and whip, in their rough power<br>
Have uncheque'd theft. Love not yourselves: away,<br>
Rob one another. There's more gold. Cut throats:<br>
All that you meet are thieves: to Athens go,<br>
Break open shops; nothing can you steal, <br>
But thieves do lose it: steal no less for this<br>
I give you; and gold confound you howsoe'er! Amen.
