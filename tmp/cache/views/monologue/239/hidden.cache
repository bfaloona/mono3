          O Caesar, what a wounding shame is this,<br>
That thou, vouchsafing here to visit me,<br>
Doing the honour of thy lordliness <br>
To one so meek, that mine own servant should<br>
Parcel the sum of my disgraces by<br>
Addition of his envy! Say, good Caesar,<br>
That I some lady trifles have reserved,<br>
Immoment toys, things of such dignity<br>
As we greet modern friends withal; and say,<br>
Some nobler token I have kept apart<br>
For Livia and Octavia, to induce<br>
Their mediation; must I be unfolded<br>
With one that I have bred? The gods! it smites me<br>
Beneath the fall I have.<br>
[To SELEUCUS]<br>
Prithee, go hence;<br>
Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits<br>
Through the ashes of my chance: wert thou a man,<br>
Thou wouldst have mercy on me.
