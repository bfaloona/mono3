          Vouchsafe to those that have not read the story,<br>
That I may prompt them: and of such as have, <br>
I humbly pray them to admit the excuse<br>
Of time, of numbers and due course of things,<br>
Which cannot in their huge and proper life<br>
Be here presented. Now we bear the king<br>
Toward Calais: grant him there; there seen, <br>
Heave him away upon your winged thoughts<br>
Athwart the sea. Behold, the English beach<br>
Pales in the flood with men, with wives and boys,<br>
Whose shouts and claps out-voice the deep mouth'd sea,<br>
Which like a mighty whiffler 'fore the king <br>
Seems to prepare his way: so let him land,<br>
And solemnly see him set on to London.<br>
So swift a pace hath thought that even now<br>
You may imagine him upon Blackheath;<br>
Where that his lords desire him to have borne <br>
His bruised helmet and his bended sword<br>
Before him through the city: he forbids it,<br>
Being free from vainness and self-glorious pride;<br>
Giving full trophy, signal and ostent<br>
Quite from himself to God. But now behold, <br>
In the quick forge and working-house of thought,<br>
How London doth pour out her citizens!<br>
The mayor and all his brethren in best sort,<br>
Like to the senators of the antique Rome,<br>
With the plebeians swarming at their heels,<br>
Go forth and fetch their conquering Caesar in:<br>
As, by a lower but loving likelihood,<br>
Were now the general of our gracious empress,<br>
As in good time he may, from Ireland coming,<br>
Bringing rebellion broached on his sword, <br>
How many would the peaceful city quit,<br>
To welcome him! much more, and much more cause,<br>
Did they this Harry. Now in London place him;<br>
As yet the lamentation of the French<br>
Invites the King of England's stay at home; <br>
The emperor's coming in behalf of France,<br>
To order peace between them; and omit<br>
All the occurrences, whatever chanced,<br>
Till Harry's back-return again to France:<br>
There must we bring him; and myself have play'd <br>
The interim, by remembering you 'tis past.<br>
Then brook abridgment, and your eyes advance,<br>
After your thoughts, straight back again to France.
