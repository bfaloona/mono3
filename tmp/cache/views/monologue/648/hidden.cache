          Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,<br>
My very noble and approved good masters,<br>
That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter,<br>
It is most true; true, I have married her:<br>
The very head and front of my offending <br>
Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,<br>
And little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace:<br>
For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith,<br>
Till now some nine moons wasted, they have used<br>
Their dearest action in the tented field, <br>
And little of this great world can I speak,<br>
More than pertains to feats of broil and battle,<br>
And therefore little shall I grace my cause<br>
In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,<br>
I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver <br>
Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,<br>
What conjuration and what mighty magic,<br>
For such proceeding I am charged withal,<br>
I won his daughter. <br>
