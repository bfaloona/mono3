          <i>[Reads]</i><br>
On a day--alack the day!--<br>
Love, whose month is ever May,<br>
Spied a blossom passing fair<br>
Playing in the wanton air:<br>
Through the velvet leaves the wind,<br>
All unseen, can passage find; <br>
That the lover, sick to death,<br>
Wish himself the heaven's breath.<br>
Air, quoth he, thy cheeks may blow;<br>
Air, would I might triumph so!<br>
But, alack, my hand is sworn <br>
Ne'er to pluck thee from thy thorn;<br>
Vow, alack, for youth unmeet,<br>
Youth so apt to pluck a sweet!<br>
Do not call it sin in me,<br>
That I am forsworn for thee; <br>
Thou for whom Jove would swear<br>
Juno but an Ethiope were;<br>
And deny himself for Jove,<br>
Turning mortal for thy love.<br>
This will I send, and something else more plain,<br>
That shall express my true love's fasting pain.<br>
O, would the king, Biron, and Longaville,<br>
Were lovers too! Ill, to example ill,<br>
Would from my forehead wipe a perjured note;<br>
For none offend where all alike do dote.
