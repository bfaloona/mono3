          <b>Prince of Morocco.</b> Mislike me not for my complexion,<br>
      The shadow'd livery of the burnish'd sun,<br>
      To whom I am a neighbour and near bred.<br>
      Bring me the fairest creature northward born,<br>
      Where Phoebus' fire scarce thaws the icicles,<br>
      And let us make incision for your love,<br>
      To prove whose blood is reddest, his or mine.<br>
      I tell thee, lady, this aspect of mine<br>
      Hath fear'd the valiant: by my love I swear<br>
      The best-regarded virgins of our clime<br>
      Have loved it too: I would not change this hue,<br>
      Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen. <br><br>

<del>    <b> Portia.</b> In terms of choice I am not solely led<br>
      By nice direction of a maiden's eyes;<br>
      Besides, the lottery of my destiny<br>
      Bars me the right of voluntary choosing: <br>
      But if my father had not scanted me<br>
      And hedged me by his wit, to yield myself<br>
      His wife who wins me by that means I told you,<br>
      Yourself, renowned prince, then stood as fair<br>
      As any comer I have look'd on yet <br>
      For my affection.</del> <br><br>

    <b> Prince of Morocco.</b> Even for that I thank you:<br>
      Therefore, I pray you, lead me to the caskets<br>
      To try my fortune. By this scimitar<br>
      That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince<br>
      That won three fields of Sultan Solyman,<br>
      I would outstare the sternest eyes that look,<br>
      Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth,<br>
      Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear,<br>
      Yea, mock the lion when he roars for prey, <br>
      To win thee, lady. But, alas the while!<br>
      If Hercules and Lichas play at dice<br>
      Which is the better man, the greater throw<br>
      May turn by fortune from the weaker hand:<br>
      So is Alcides beaten by his page; <br>
      And so may I, blind fortune leading me,<br>
      Miss that which one unworthier may attain,<br>
      And die with grieving.
