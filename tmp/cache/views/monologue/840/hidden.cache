           Come, poor babe:<br>
 I have heard, but not believed,<br>
 the spirits o' the dead<br>
 May walk again: if such thing be, thy mother<br>
 Appear'd to me last night, for ne'er was dream <br>
 So like a waking. To me comes a creature,<br>
 Sometimes her head on one side, some another;<br>
 I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,<br>
 So fill'd and so becoming: in pure white robes,<br>
 Like very sanctity, she did approach <br>
 My cabin where I lay; thrice bow'd before me,<br>
 And gasping to begin some speech, her eyes<br>
 Became two spouts: the fury spent, anon<br>
 Did this break-from her: 'Good Antigonus,<br>
 Since fate, against thy better disposition, <br>
 Hath made thy person for the thrower-out<br>
 Of my poor babe, according to thine oath,<br>
 Places remote enough are in Bohemia,<br>
 There weep and leave it crying; and, for the babe<br>
 Is counted lost for ever, Perdita, <br>
 I prithee, call't. For this ungentle business<br>
 Put on thee by my lord, thou ne'er shalt see<br>
 Thy wife Paulina more.' And so, with shrieks<br>
 She melted into air. Affrighted much,<br>
 I did in time collect myself and thought <br>
 This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys:<br>
 Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously,<br>
 I will be squared by this. I do believe<br>
 Hermione hath suffer'd death, and that<br>
 Apollo would, this being indeed the issue <br>
 Of King Polixenes, it should here be laid,<br>
 Either for life or death, upon the earth<br>
 Of its right father. Blossom, speed thee well!<br>
 There lie, and there thy character: there these;<br>
 Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty, <br>
 And still rest thine. The storm begins; poor wretch,<br>
 That for thy mother's fault art thus exposed<br>
 To loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot,<br>
 But my heart bleeds; and most accursed am I<br>
 To be by oath enjoin'd to this. Farewell! <br>
 The day frowns more and more: thou'rt like to have<br>
 A lullaby too rough: I never saw<br>
 The heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!<br>
 Well may I get aboard! This is the chase:<br>
 I am gone for ever. <br>
