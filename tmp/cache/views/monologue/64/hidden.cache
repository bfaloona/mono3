      What, dead, my dove? <br>
      O Pyramus, arise!<br>
      Speak, speak. Quite dumb?<br>
      Dead, dead? A tomb<br>
      Must cover thy sweet eyes.<br>
      These My lips, <br>
      This cherry nose,<br>
      These yellow cowslip cheeks,<br>
      Are gone, are gone:<br>
      Lovers, make moan:<br>
      His eyes were green as leeks.<br>
      O Sisters Three,<br>
      Come, come to me,<br>
      With hands as pale as milk;<br>
      Lay them in gore,<br>
      Since you have shore <br>
      With shears his thread of silk.<br>
      Tongue, not a word:<br>
      Come, trusty sword;<br>
      Come, blade, my breast imbrue:<br>
      <i>[Stabs herself]</i> <br>
      And, farewell, friends;<br>
      Thus Thisby ends:<br>
      Adieu, adieu, adieu. <br><br>
