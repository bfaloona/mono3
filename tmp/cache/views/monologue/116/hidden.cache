          Thou told'st me, when we came from horse, the place<br>
Was near at hand: ne'er long'd my mother so<br>
To see me first, as I have now. Pisanio! man!<br>
Where is Posthumus? What is in thy mind,<br>
That makes thee stare thus? Wherefore breaks that sigh<br> 
From the inward of thee? One, but painted thus,<br>
Would be interpreted a thing perplex'd<br> 
Beyond self-explication; put thyself <br>
Into a haviour of less fear, ere wildness<br> 
Vanquish my staider senses. What's the matter?<br>
Why tender'st thou that paper to me with <br>
A look untender? If 't be summer news, <br>
Smile to 't before; if winterly, thou need'st<br> 
But keep that count'nance still. My husband's hand! <br>
That drug-damn'd Italy hath out-craftied him,  <br>
And he's at some hard point. Speak, man; thy tongue<br> 
May take off some extremity, which to read <br>
Would be even mortal to me.<br>
