          And what's he then that says I play the villain?<br>
When this advice is free I give and honest,<br>
Probal to thinking and indeed the course <br>
To win the Moor again? For 'tis most easy<br>
The inclining Desdemona to subdue<br>
In any honest suit: she's framed as fruitful<br>
As the free elements. And then for her<br>
To win the Moorâ€”were't to renounce his baptism, <br>
All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,<br>
His soul is so enfetter'd to her love,<br>
That she may make, unmake, do what she list,<br>
Even as her appetite shall play the god<br>
With his weak function. How am I then a villain <br>
To counsel Cassio to this parallel course,<br>
Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!<br>
When devils will the blackest sins put on,<br>
They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,<br>
As I do now: for whiles this honest fool <br>
Plies Desdemona to repair his fortunes<br>
And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,<br>
I'll pour this pestilence into his ear,<br>
That she repeals him for her body's lust;<br>
And by how much she strives to do him good, <br>
She shall undo her credit with the Moor.<br>
So will I turn her virtue into pitch,<br>
And out of her own goodness make the net<br>
That shall enmesh them all. <br>
