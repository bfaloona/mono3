          These are the forgeries of jealousy:<br>
And never, since the middle summer's spring,<br>
Met we on hill, in dale, forest or mead,<br>
By paved fountain or by rushy brook,<br>
Or in the beached margent of the sea,<br>
To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind, <br>
But with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport.<br>
Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,<br>
As in revenge, have suck'd up from the sea<br>
Contagious fogs; which falling in the land<br>
Have every pelting river made so proud <br>
That they have overborne their continents:<br>
The ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain,<br>
The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn<br>
Hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard;<br>
The fold stands empty in the drowned field,<br>
And crows are fatted with the murrion flock;<br>
The nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud,<br>
And the quaint mazes in the wanton green<br>
For lack of tread are undistinguishable:<br>
The human mortals want their winter here;<br>
No night is now with hymn or carol blest:<br>
Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,<br>
Pale in her anger, washes all the air,<br>
That rheumatic diseases do abound:<br>
And thorough this distemperature we see <br>
The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts<br>
Far in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,<br>
And on old Hiems' thin and icy crown<br>
An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds<br>
Is, as in mockery, set: the spring, the summer,<br>
The childing autumn, angry winter, change<br>
Their wonted liveries, and the mazed world,<br>
By their increase, now knows not which is which:<br>
And this same progeny of evils comes<br>
From our debate, from our dissension; <br>
We are their parents and original.
