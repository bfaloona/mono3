          Madam, your father here doth intimate<br>
The payment of a hundred thousand crowns;<br>
Being but the one half of an entire sum <br>
Disbursed by my father in his wars.<br>
But say that he or we, as neither have,<br>
Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid<br>
A hundred thousand more; in surety of the which,<br>
One part of Aquitaine is bound to us, <br>
Although not valued to the money's worth.<br>
If then the king your father will restore<br>
But that one half which is unsatisfied,<br>
We will give up our right in Aquitaine,<br>
And hold fair friendship with his majesty. <br>
But that, it seems, he little purposeth,<br>
For here he doth demand to have repaid<br>
A hundred thousand crowns; and not demands,<br>
On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,<br>
To have his title live in Aquitaine; <br>
Which we much rather had depart withal<br>
And have the money by our father lent<br>
Than Aquitaine so gelded as it is.<br>
Dear Princess, were not his requests so far<br>
From reason's yielding, your fair self should make<br>
A yielding 'gainst some reason in my breast<br>
And go well satisfied to France again.
