          Princes, that strive by factions and by friends<br>
Ambitiously for rule and empery,<br>
Know that the people of Rome, for whom we stand<br>
A special party, have, by common voice,<br>
In election for the Roman empery,<br>
Chosen Andronicus, surnamed Pius<br>
For many good and great deserts to Rome:<br>
A nobler man, a braver warrior, <br>
Lives not this day within the city walls:<br>
He by the senate is accit'd home<br>
From weary wars against the barbarous Goths;<br>
That, with his sons, a terror to our foes,<br>
Hath yoked a nation strong, train'd up in arms. <br>
Ten years are spent since first he undertook<br>
This cause of Rome and chastised with arms<br>
Our enemies' pride: five times he hath return'd<br>
Bleeding to Rome, bearing his valiant sons<br>
In coffins from the field; <br>
And now at last, laden with horror's spoils,<br>
Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,<br>
Renowned Titus, flourishing in arms.<br>
Let us entreat, by honour of his name,<br>
Whom worthily you would have now succeed. <br>
And in the Capitol and senate's right,<br>
Whom you pretend to honour and adore,<br>
That you withdraw you and abate your strength;<br>
Dismiss your followers and, as suitors should,<br>
Plead your deserts in peace and humbleness.
