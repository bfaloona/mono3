          'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,<br>
Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog<br>
And little mouse, every unworthy thing,<br>
Live here in heaven and may look on her;<br>
But Romeo may not: more validity,<br>
More honourable state, more courtship lives<br>
In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize<br>
On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand<br>
And steal immortal blessing from her lips,<br>
Who even in pure and vestal modesty,<br>
Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;<br>
But Romeo may not; he is banished:<br>
Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:<br>
They are free men, but I am banished.<br>
And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?<br>
Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,<br>
No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,<br>
But 'banished' to kill me?.'banished'?<br>
O friar, the damned use that word in hell;<br>
Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,<br>
Being a divine, a ghostly confessor, <br>
A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,<br>
To mangle me with that word 'banished'?
