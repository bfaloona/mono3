          What letter is this same? What's here? 'To Silvia'!<br>
And here an engine fit for my proceeding.<br>
I'll be so bold to break the seal for once.<br>
<i>[Reads]</i><br>
'My thoughts do harbour with my Silvia nightly,<br>
And slaves they are to me that send them flying:<br>
O, could their master come and go as lightly,<br>
Himself would lodge where senseless they are lying!<br>
My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them:<br>
While I, their king, that hither them importune,<br>
Do curse the grace that with such grace hath bless'd them,<br>
Because myself do want my servants' fortune:<br>
I curse myself, for they are sent by me, <br>
That they should harbour where their lord would be.'<br>
What's here?<br>
'Silvia, this night I will enfranchise thee.'<br>
'Tis so; and here's the ladder for the purpose.<br>
Why, Phaeton,â€”for thou art Merops' son,â€” <br>
Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car<br>
And with thy daring folly burn the world?<br>
Wilt thou reach stars, because they shine on thee?<br>
Go, base intruder! overweening slave!<br>
Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates,<br>
And think my patience, more than thy desert,<br>
Is privilege for thy departure hence:<br>
Thank me for this more than for all the favours<br>
Which all too much I have bestow'd on thee.<br>
But if thou linger in my territories <br>
Longer than swiftest expedition<br>
Will give thee time to leave our royal court,<br>
By heaven! my wrath shall far exceed the love<br>
I ever bore my daughter or thyself.<br>
Be gone! I will not hear thy vain excuse; <br>
But, as thou lovest thy life, make speed from hence.
