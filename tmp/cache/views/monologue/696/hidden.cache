          Why, I have not another tear to shed:<br>
Besides, this sorrow is an enemy,<br>
And would usurp upon my watery eyes<br>
And make them blind with tributary tears: <br>
Then which way shall I find Revenge's cave?<br>
For these two heads do seem to speak to me,<br>
And threat me I shall never come to bliss<br>
Till all these mischiefs be return'd again<br>
Even in their throats that have committed them. <br>
Come, let me see what task I have to do.<br>
You heavy people, circle me about,<br>
That I may turn me to each one of you,<br>
And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs.<br>
The vow is made. Come, brother, take a head; <br>
And in this hand the other I will bear.<br>
Lavinia, thou shalt be employ'd: these arms!<br>
Bear thou my hand, sweet wench, between thy teeth.<br>
As for thee, boy, go get thee from my sight;<br>
Thou art an exile, and thou must not stay: <br>
Hie to the Goths, and raise an army there:<br>
And, if you love me, as I think you do,<br>
Let's kiss and part, for we have much to do.
