          Words, vows, gifts, tears, and love's full sacrifice,<br>
He offers in another's enterprise; <br>
But more in Troilus thousand fold I see<br>
Than in the glass of Pandar's praise may be;<br>
Yet hold I off. Women are angels, wooing:<br>
Things won are done; joy's soul lies in the doing.<br>
That she beloved knows nought that knows not this:<br>
Men prize the thing ungain'd more than it is:<br>
That she was never yet that ever knew<br>
Love got so sweet as when desire did sue.<br>
Therefore this maxim out of love I teach:<br>
Achievement is command; ungain'd, beseech:<br>
Then though my heart's content firm love doth bear,<br>
Nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear.
