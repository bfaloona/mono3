      <div class="monologue_preview">
          The providence that's in a watchful state<br>
Knows almost every grain of Plutus' gold,<br>
Finds bottom in the uncomprehensive deeps,<br>
Keeps place with thought and almost, like the gods,<br>
Does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles. <br>
There is a mysteryâ€”with whom relation<br>
Durst never meddleâ€”in the soul of state;<br>
Which hath an operation more divine<br>
Than breath or pen can give expressure to:<br>
All the commerce that you have had with Troy <br>
As perfectly is ours as yours, my lord;<br>
And better would it fit Achilles much<br>
To throw down Hector than Polyxena:<br>
But it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home,<br>
When fame shall in our islands sound her trump, <br>
And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing,<br>
'Great Hector's sister did Achilles win,<br>
But our great Ajax bravely beat down him.'<br>
Farewell, my lord: I as your lover speak;<br>
The fool slides o'er the ice that you should break.
