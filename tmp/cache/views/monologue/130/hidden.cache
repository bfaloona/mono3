          Still going? <br>
[<i>Exit Lord</i>]
<div align='center'>This is a lord! O noble misery,</div>
To be i' the field, and ask 'what news?' of me!<br>
To-day how many would have given their honours<br>
To have saved their carcasses! took heel to do't,<br>
And yet died too! I, in mine own woe charm'd,<br>
Could not find death where I did hear him groan, <br>
Nor feel him where he struck: being an ugly monster,<br>
'Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups, soft beds,<br>
Sweet words; or hath more ministers than we<br>
That draw his knives i' the war. Well, I will find him<br>
For being now a favourer to the Briton, <br>
No more a Briton, I have resumed again<br>
The part I came in: fight I will no more,<br>
But yield me to the veriest hind that shall<br>
Once touch my shoulder. Great the slaughter is<br>
Here made by the Roman; great the answer be <br>
Britons must take. For me, my ransom's death;<br>
On either side I come to spend my breath;<br>
Which neither here I'll keep nor bear again,<br>
But end it by some means for Imogen. <br>
