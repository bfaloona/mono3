           In this last tempest. I perceive these lords<br>
At this encounter do so much admire<br>
That they devour their reason and scarce think<br>
Their eyes do offices of truth, their words<br>
Are natural breath: but, howsoe'er you have<br>
Been justled from your senses, know for certain<br>
That I am Prospero and that very duke<br>
Which was thrust forth of Milan, who most strangely<br>
Upon this shore, where you were wreck'd, was landed,<br>
To be the lord on't. No more yet of this;<br>
For 'tis a chronicle of day by day,<br>
Not a relation for a breakfast nor<br>
Befitting this first meeting. Welcome, sir;<br>
This cell's my court: here have I few attendants<br>
And subjects none abroad: pray you, look in.<br>
My dukedom since you have given me again,<br>
I will requite you with as good a thing;<br>
At least bring forth a wonder, to content ye<br>
As much as me my dukedom.
