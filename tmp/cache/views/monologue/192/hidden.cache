          Even as a flatt'ring dream or worthless fancy.<br>
Then take him up, and manage well the jest:<br>
Carry him gently to my fairest chamber,<br>
And hang it round with all my wanton pictures;<br>
Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters,<br>
And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet; <br>
Procure me music ready when he wakes,<br>
To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound;<br>
And if he chance to speak, be ready straight,<br>
And with a low submissive reverence<br>
Say 'What is it your honour will command?' <br>
Let one attend him with a silver basin<br>
Full of rose-water and bestrew'd with flowers;<br>
Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper,<br>
And say 'Will't please your lordship cool your hands?'<br>
Some one be ready with a costly suit, <br>
And ask him what apparel he will wear;<br>
Another tell him of his hounds and horse,<br>
And that his lady mourns at his disease;<br>
Persuade him that he hath been lunatic,<br>
And, when he says he is, say that he dreams, <br>
For he is nothing but a mighty lord.<br>
This do, and do it kindly, gentle sirs;<br>
It will be pastime passing excellent,<br>
If it be husbanded with modesty.
