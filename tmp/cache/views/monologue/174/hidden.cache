          <div align=right>O sweet Portia,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
Here are a few of the unpleasant'st words<br>
That ever blotted paper! Gentle lady,<br>
When I did first impart my love to you,<br>
I freely told you, all the wealth I had<br>
Ran in my veins, I was a gentleman;<br>
And then I told you true: and yet, dear lady,<br>
Rating myself at nothing, you shall see<br>
How much I was a braggart. When I told you<br>
My state was nothing, I should then have told you <br>
That I was worse than nothing; for, indeed,<br>
I have engaged myself to a dear friend,<br>
Engaged my friend to his mere enemy,<br>
To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady;<br>
The paper as the body of my friend, <br>
And every word in it a gaping wound,<br>
Issuing life-blood. But is it true, Salerio?<br>
Have all his ventures fail'd? What, not one hit?<br>
From Tripolis, from Mexico and England,<br>
From Lisbon, Barbary and India? <br>
And not one vessel 'scape the dreadful touch<br>
Of merchant-marring rocks?
