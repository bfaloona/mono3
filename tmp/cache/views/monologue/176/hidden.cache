          But little: I am arm'd and well prepared.<br>
Give me your hand, Bassanio: fare you well! <br>
Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you;<br>
For herein Fortune shows herself more kind<br>
Than is her custom: it is still her use<br>
To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,<br>
To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow<br>
An age of poverty; from which lingering penance<br>
Of such misery doth she cut me off.<br>
Commend me to your honourable wife:<br>
Tell her the process of Antonio's end;<br>
Say how I loved you, speak me fair in death; <br>
And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge<br>
Whether Bassanio had not once a love.<br>
Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,<br>
And he repents not that he pays your debt;<br>
For if the Jew do cut but deep enough,<br>
I'll pay it presently with all my heart.
