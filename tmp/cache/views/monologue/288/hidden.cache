          Why, all his behaviors did make their retire<br>
To the court of his eye, peeping thorough desire:<br>
His heart, like an agate, with your print impress'd,<br>
Proud with his form, in his eye pride express'd:<br>
His tongue, all impatient to speak and not see,<br>
Did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be;<br>
All senses to that sense did make their repair, <br>
To feel only looking on fairest of fair:<br>
Methought all his senses were lock'd in his eye,<br>
As jewels in crystal for some prince to buy;<br>
Who, tendering their own worth from where they were glass'd,<br>
Did point you to buy them, along as you pass'd: <br>
His face's own margent did quote such amazes<br>
That all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes.<br>
I'll give you Aquitaine and all that is his,<br>
An you give him for my sake but one loving kiss.<br>
