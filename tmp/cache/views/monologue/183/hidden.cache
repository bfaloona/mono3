          <b>Claudio.</b> <del>Sweet prince, you learn me noble thankfulness.</del><br>
      There, Leonato, take her back again:<br>
      Give not this rotten orange to your friend;<br>
      She's but the sign and semblance of her honour.<br>
      Behold how like a maid she blushes here!<br>
      O, what authority and show of truth<br>
      Can cunning sin cover itself withal!<br>
      Comes not that blood as modest evidence<br>
      To witness simple virtue? Would you not swear,<br>
      All you that see her, that she were a maid,<br>
      By these exterior shows? But she is none:<br>
      She knows the heat of a luxurious bed;<br>
      Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty. <br><br>

<del><b>Leonato.</b> What do you mean, my lord? </del><br><br>

<b>Claudio.</b> Not to be married,<br>
      Not to knit my soul to an approved wanton.<br><br>

<del><b>Leonato.</b> Dear my lord, if you, in your own proof,<br>
      Have vanquish'd the resistance of her youth,<br>
      And made defeat of her virginity,-- </del><br><br>

<b>Claudio.</b> I know what you would say: if I have known her,<br>
      You will say she did embrace me as a husband, <br>
      And so extenuate the 'forehand sin:<br>
      No, Leonato,<br>
      I never tempted her with word too large;<br>
      But, as a brother to his sister, show'd<br>
      Bashful sincerity and comely love.<br><br>

<del><b> Hero.</b> And seem'd I ever otherwise to you? </del><br><br>

<b>Claudio.</b> Out on thee! Seeming! I will write against it:<br>
      You seem to me as Dian in her orb,<br>
      As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown;<br>
      But you are more intemperate in your blood<br>
      Than Venus, or those pamper'd animals<br>
      That rage in savage sensuality. <br><br>

<del> <b>Hero.</b> Is my lord well, that he doth speak so wide?<br><br>

<b>Leonato.</b> Sweet prince, why speak not you? <br><br>

<b>Don Pedro.</b> What should I speak? <br>
      I stand dishonour'd, that have gone about<br>
      To link my dear friend to a common stale. <br><br>

<b>Leonato.</b> Are these things spoken, or do I but dream? <br><br>

<b>Don John.</b> Sir, they are spoken, and these things are true.<br><br> 

<b>Benedick.</b> This looks not like a nuptial. <br><br>

<b>Hero.</b> True! O God! </del><br><br>

<b>Claudio.</b> Leonato, stand I here?<br>
      Is this the prince? is this the prince's brother?<br>
      Is this face Hero's? are our eyes our own? <br><br>

<del><b>Leonato.</b> All this is so: but what of this, my lord?</del><br><br>

<b>Claudio.</b> Let me but move one question to your daughter;<br>
      And, by that fatherly and kindly power<br>
      That you have in her, bid her answer truly. <br><br>

<del><b>Leonato.</b> I charge thee do so, as thou art my child.<br><br> 

<b>Hero.</b> O, God defend me! how am I beset!<br>
      What kind of catechising call you this? </del><br><br>

<b>Claudio.</b> To make you answer truly to your name. <br><br>

<del><b>Hero.</b> Is it not Hero? Who can blot that name<br>
      With any just reproach? </del><br><br>

<del><b>Claudio.</b> Marry, that can Hero;</del><br>
      Hero itself can blot out Hero's virtue.<br>
      What man was he talk'd with you yesternight<br>
      Out at your window betwixt twelve and one?<br>
      <del>Now, if you are a maid, answer to this.</del> <br><br>

    <del><b>Hero.</b> I talk'd with no man at that hour, my lord.<br><br>

<b>Don Pedro.</b> Why, then are you no maiden. Leonato,<br>
      I am sorry you must hear: upon mine honour,<br>
      Myself, my brother and this grieved count<br>
      Did see her, hear her, at that hour last night<br>
      Talk with a ruffian at her chamber-window <br>
      Who hath indeed, most like a liberal villain,<br>
      Confess'd the vile encounters they have had<br>
      A thousand times in secret. <br><br>

    <b>Don John.</b> Fie, fie! they are not to be named, my lord,<br>
      Not to be spoke of; <br>
      There is not chastity enough in language<br>
      Without offence to utter them. Thus, pretty lady,<br>
      I am sorry for thy much misgovernment. </del><br><br>

<b>Claudio.</b> O Hero, what a Hero hadst thou been,<br>
      If half thy outward graces had been placed<br>
      About thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart!<br>
      But fare thee well, most foul, most fair! farewell,<br>
      Thou pure impiety and impious purity!<br>
      For thee I'll lock up all the gates of love,<br>
      And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang,<br>
      To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm,<br>
      And never shall it more be gracious.
