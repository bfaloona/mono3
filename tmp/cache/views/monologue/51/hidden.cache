          Full of vexation come I, with complaint<br>
Against my child, my daughter Hermia.<br>
Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,<br>
This man hath my consent to marry her.<br>
Stand forth, Lysander: and my gracious duke,<br>
This man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child;<br>
Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,<br>
And interchanged love-tokens with my child:<br>
Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,<br>
With feigning voice verses of feigning love, <br>
And stolen the impression of her fantasy<br>
With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,<br>
Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats, messengers<br>
Of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth:<br>
With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart,<br>
Turn'd her obedience, which is due to me,<br>
To stubborn harshness: and, my gracious duke,<br>
Be it so she; will not here before your grace<br>
Consent to marry with Demetrius,<br>
I beg the ancient privilege of Athens,<br>
As she is mine, I may dispose of her:<br>
Which shall be either to this gentleman<br>
Or to her death, according to our law<br>
Immediately provided in that case.
