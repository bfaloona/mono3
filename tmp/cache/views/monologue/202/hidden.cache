          Thus have I politicly begun my reign,<br>
And 'tis my hope to end successfully. <br>
My falcon now is sharp and passing empty.<br>
And till she stoop she must not be full-gorg'd,<br>
For then she never looks upon her lure.<br>
Another way I have to man my haggard,<br>
To make her come, and know her keeper's call,<br>
That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites<br>
That bate and beat, and will not be obedient.<br>
She eat no meat to-day, nor none shall eat;<br>
Last night she slept not, nor to-night she shall not;<br>
As with the meat, some undeserved fault <br>
I'll find about the making of the bed;<br>
And here I'll fling the pillow, there the bolster,<br>
This way the coverlet, another way the sheets;<br>
Ay, and amid this hurly I intend<br>
That all is done in reverend care of her-<br>
And, in conclusion, she shall watch all night;<br>
And if she chance to nod I'll rail and brawl<br>
And with the clamour keep her still awake.<br>
This is a way to kill a wife with kindness,<br>
And thus I'll curb her mad and headstrong humour.<br>
He that knows better how to tame a shrew,<br>
Now let him speak; 'tis charity to show.
