          How many thousands of my poorest subjects<br>
Are at this hour asleep! O sleep, O gentle sleep,<br>
Nature's soft nurse, how have I frightened thee,<br>
That thou no more will weigh my eyelids down,<br>
And steep my senses in forgetfulness?<br>
Why rather, sleep, liest thou in smoky cribs,<br>
Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee,<br>
And hush'd with buzzing night-flies to thy slumber,<br>
Than in the perfum'd chambers of the great,<br>
Under the canopies of costly state,<br>
And lull'd with sound of sweetest melody?<br>
O thou dull god, why liest thou with the vile<br>
In loathsome beds, and leav'st the kingly couch<br>
A watch-case or a common 'larum-bell?<br>
Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast<br>
Seal up the ship-boy's eyes, and rock his brains<br>
In cradle of the rude imperious surge,<br>
And in the visitation of the winds,<br>
Who take the ruffian billows by the top,<br>
Curling their monstrous heads, and hanging them<br>
With deafing clamour in the slippery clouds,<br>
That with the hurly death itself awakes?<br>
Canst thou, O partial sleep, give thy repose<br>
To the wet sea-boy in an hour so rude;<br>
And in the calmest and most stillest night,<br>
With all appliances and means to boot,<br>
Deny it to a king? Then, happy low, lie down!<br>
Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.
