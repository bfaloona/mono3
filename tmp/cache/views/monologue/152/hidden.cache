          This fellow pecks up wit as pigeons pease,<br>
And utters it again when God doth please:<br>
He is wit's pedler, and retails his wares <br>
At wakes and wassails, meetings, markets, fairs;<br>
And we that sell by gross, the Lord doth know,<br>
Have not the grace to grace it with such show.<br>
This gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve;<br>
Had he been Adam, he had tempted Eve; <br>
A' can carve too, and lisp: why, this is he<br>
That kiss'd his hand away in courtesy;<br>
This is the ape of form, monsieur the nice,<br>
That, when he plays at tables, chides the dice<br>
In honourable terms: nay, he can sing <br>
A mean most meanly; and in ushering<br>
Mend him who can: the ladies call him sweet;<br>
The stairs, as he treads on them, kiss his feet:<br>
This is the flower that smiles on every one,<br>
To show his teeth as white as whale's bone; <br>
And consciences, that will not die in debt,<br>
Pay him the due of honey-tongued Boyet.
