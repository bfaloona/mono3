OLD receptacles, or common shores, of filth;<br>
Serve by indenture to the common hangman:<br>
Any of these ways are yet better than this;<br>
For what thou professest, a baboon, could he speak,<br>
Would own a name too dear. O, that the gods<br>
Would safely deliver me from this place!<br>
Here, here's gold for thee.<br>
If that thy master would gain by thee,<br>
Proclaim that I can sing, weave, sew, and dance,<br>
With other virtues, which I'll keep from boast: <br>
And I will undertake all these to teach.<br>
I doubt not but this populous city will<br>
Yield many scholars.
