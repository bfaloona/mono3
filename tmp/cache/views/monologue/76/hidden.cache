          O! were that all. I think not on my father;<br>
And these great tears grace his remembrance more<br>  
Than those I shed for him. What was he like? <br>
I have forgot him: my imagination  <br>
Carries no favour in 't but Bertram's. <br>
I am undone: there is no living, none,  <br>
If Bertram be away. It were all one <br>
That I should love a bright particular star<br>
And think to wed it, he is so above me: <br>
In his bright radiance and collateral light <br>
Must I be comforted, not in his sphere. <br>
The ambition in my love thus plagues itself: <br>
The hind that would be mated by the lion <br>
Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though a plague,<br> 
To see him every hour; to sit and draw <br>
His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,<br>
In our heart's table; heart too capable <br>
Of every line and trick of his sweet favour:<br> 
But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy <br>
Must sanctify his reliques. Who comes here? <br>
One that goes with him: I love him for his sake;<br> 
And yet I know him a notorious liar, <br>
Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;<br> 
Yet these fix'd evils sit so fit in him, <br>
That they take place, when virtue's steely bones<br> 
Look bleak in the cold wind: withal, full oft we see <br>
Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.<br>
