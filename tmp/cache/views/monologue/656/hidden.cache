          Think'st thou I'ld make a lie of jealousy,<br>
To follow still the changes of the moon <br>
With fresh suspicions? No; to be once in doubt<br>
Is once to be resolved: exchange me for a goat,<br>
When I shall turn the business of my soul<br>
To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,<br>
Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me jealous <br>
To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,<br>
Is free of speech, sings, plays and dances well;<br>
Where virtue is, these are more virtuous:<br>
Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw<br>
The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt; <br>
For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago;<br>
I'll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;<br>
And on the proof, there is no more but this,â€”<br>
Away at once with love or jealousy! <br>
