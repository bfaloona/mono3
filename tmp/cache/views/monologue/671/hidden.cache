          How! have they denied him?<br>
Has Ventidius and Lucullus denied him?<br>
And does he send to me? Three? hum!<br>
It shows but little love or judgment in him:<br>
Must I be his last refuge! His friends, like <br>
physicians,<br>
Thrive, give him over: must I take the cure upon me?<br>
Has much disgraced me in't; I'm angry at him,<br>
That might have known my place: I see no sense for't,<br>
But his occasion might have woo'd me first;<br>
For, in my conscience, I was the first man<br>
That e'er received gift from him:<br>
And does he think so backwardly of me now,<br>
That I'll requite its last? No:<br>
So it may prove an argument of laughter <br>
To the rest, and 'mongst lords I be thought a fool.<br>
I'ld rather than the worth of thrice the sum,<br>
Had sent to me first, but for my mind's sake;<br>
I'd such a courage to do him good. But now return,<br>
And with their faint reply this answer join; <br>
Who bates mine honour shall not know my coin.
