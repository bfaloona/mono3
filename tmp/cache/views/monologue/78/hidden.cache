          If ever we are nature's, these are ours; this thorn <Br>
Doth to our rose of youth rightly belong; <Br>
Our blood to us, this to our blood is born: <Br>
It is the show and seal of nature's truth, <Br>
Where love's strong passion is impress'd in youth: <Br>
By our remembrances of days foregone, <Br>
Such were our faults; or then we thought them none.<Br> 
Her eye is sick on't: I observe her now.
