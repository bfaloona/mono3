          Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house,<br>
As beaten hence by your strange lunacy.<br>
O noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth!<br>
Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment,<br>
And banish hence these abject lowly dreams.<br>
Look how thy servants do attend on thee,<br>
Each in his office ready at thy beck.<br>
Wilt thou have music? Hark! Apollo plays, <br>
<i>[Music]</i><br>
And twenty caged nightingales do sing. <br>
Or wilt thou sleep? We'll have thee to a couch<br>
Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed<br>
On purpose trimm'd up for Semiramis.<br>
Say thou wilt walk: we will bestrew the ground.<br>
Or wilt thou ride? Thy horses shall be trapp'd, <br>
Their harness studded all with gold and pearl.<br>
Dost thou love hawking? Thou hast hawks will soar<br>
Above the morning lark. Or wilt thou hunt?<br>
Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them<br>
And fetch shall echoes from the hollow earth.
