          Marry, this well carried shall on her behalf<br>
Change slander to remorse; that is some good:<br>
But not for that dream I on this strange course,<br>
But on this travail look for greater birth. <br>
She dying, as it must so be maintain'd,<br>
Upon the instant that she was accused,<br>
Shall be lamented, pitied and excused<br>
Of every hearer: for it so falls out<br>
That what we have we prize not to the worth<br>
Whiles we enjoy it, but being lack'd and lost,<br>
Why, then we rack the value, then we find<br>
The virtue that possession would not show us<br>
Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio:<br>
When he shall hear she died upon his words, <br>
The idea of her life shall sweetly creep<br>
Into his study of imagination,<br>
And every lovely organ of her life<br>
Shall come apparell'd in more precious habit,<br>
More moving-delicate and full of life,<br>
Into the eye and prospect of his soul,<br>
Than when she lived indeed; then shall he mourn,<br>
If ever love had interest in his liver,<br>
And wish he had not so accused her,<br>
No, though he thought his accusation true.<br>
Let this be so, and doubt not but success<br>
Will fashion the event in better shape<br>
Than I can lay it down in likelihood.<br>
But if all aim but this be levell'd false,<br>
The supposition of the lady's death<br>
Will quench the wonder of her infamy:<br>
And if it sort not well, you may conceal her,<br>
As best befits her wounded reputation,<br>
In some reclusive and religious life,<br>
Out of all eyes, tongues, minds and injuries.
