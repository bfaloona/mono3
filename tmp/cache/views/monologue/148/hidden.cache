          <b>Biron.</b> Sweet lords, sweet lovers, O, let us embrace!<br>
      As true we are as flesh and blood can be:<br>
      The sea will ebb and flow, heaven show his face;<br>
      Young blood doth not obey an old decree:<br>
      We cannot cross the cause why we were born;<br>
      Therefore of all hands must we be forsworn. <br><br>

<del> <b>Ferdinand.</b> What, did these rent lines show some love of thine?</del><br><br>

<b>Biron.</b><br> Did they, quoth you? Who sees the heavenly Rosaline, <br>
      That, like a rude and savage man of Inde,<br>
      At the first opening of the gorgeous east,<br>
      Bows not his vassal head and strucken blind<br>
      Kisses the base ground with obedient breast?<br>
      What peremptory eagle-sighted eye <br>
      Dares look upon the heaven of her brow,<br>
      That is not blinded by her majesty? <br><br>

<del><b>Ferdinand.</b> What zeal, what fury hath inspired thee now?<br>
      My love, her mistress, is a gracious moon;<br>
      She an attending star, scarce seen a light. </del><br><br>

<b>Biron.</b> My eyes are then no eyes, nor I Biron:<br>
      O, but for my love, day would turn to night!<br>
      Of all complexions the cull'd sovereignty<br>
      Do meet, as at a fair, in her fair cheek,<br>
      Where several worthies make one dignity, <br>
      Where nothing wants that want itself doth seek.<br>
      Lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues,--<br>
      Fie, painted rhetoric! O, she needs it not:<br>
      To things of sale a seller's praise belongs,<br>
      She passes praise; then praise too short doth blot.<br>
      A wither'd hermit, five-score winters worn,<br>
      Might shake off fifty, looking in her eye:<br>
      Beauty doth varnish age, as if new-born,<br>
      And gives the crutch the cradle's infancy:<br>
      O, 'tis the sun that maketh all things shine. <br><br>

<del><b>Ferdinand.</b> By heaven, thy love is black as ebony. </del><br><br>

<b>Biron.</b> Is ebony like her? O wood divine!<br>
      A wife of such wood were felicity.<br>
      O, who can give an oath? where is a book?<br>
      That I may swear beauty doth beauty lack, <br>
      If that she learn not of her eye to look:<br>
      No face is fair that is not full so black. <br><br>

<del><b>Ferdinand.</b> O paradox! Black is the badge of hell,<br>
      The hue of dungeons and the suit of night;<br>
      And beauty's crest becomes the heavens well.</del><br><br>

<b>Biron.</b> Devils soonest tempt, resembling spirits of light.<br>
      O, if in black my lady's brows be deck'd,<br>
      It mourns that painting and usurping hair<br>
      Should ravish doters with a false aspect;<br>
      And therefore is she born to make black fair. <br>
      Her favour turns the fashion of the days,<br>
      For native blood is counted painting now;<br>
      And therefore red, that would avoid dispraise,<br>
      Paints itself black, to imitate her brow.
