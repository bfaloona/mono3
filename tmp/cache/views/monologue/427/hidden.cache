          Nothing but well to thee, Thomas of Clarence.<br>
How chance thou art not with the Prince thy brother?<br>
He loves thee, and thou dost neglect him, Thomas.<br>
Thou hast a better place in his affection <br>
Than all thy brothers; cherish it, my boy,<br>
And noble offices thou mayst effect<br>
Of mediation, after I am dead,<br>
Between his greatness and thy other brethren.<br>
Therefore omit him not; blunt not his love,<br>
Nor lose the good advantage of his grace<br>
By seeming cold or careless of his will;<br>
For he is gracious if he be observ'd.<br>
He hath a tear for pity and a hand<br>
Open as day for melting charity;<br>
Yet notwithstanding, being incens'd, he is flint;<br>
As humorous as winter, and as sudden<br>
As flaws congealed in the spring of day.<br>
His temper, therefore, must be well observ'd.<br>
Chide him for faults, and do it reverently,<br>
When you perceive his blood inclin'd to mirth;<br>
But, being moody, give him line and scope<br>
Till that his passions, like a whale on ground,<br>
Confound themselves with working. Learn this, Thomas,<br>
And thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends,<br>
A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in,<br>
That the united vessel of their blood,<br>
Mingled with venom of suggestionâ€”<br>
As, force perforce, the age will pour it inâ€”<br>
Shall never leak, though it do work as strong<br>
As aconitum or rash gunpowder.
