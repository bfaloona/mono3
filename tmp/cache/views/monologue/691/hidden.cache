          Madam, though Venus govern your desires,<br>
Saturn is dominator over mine:<br>
What signifies my deadly-standing eye, <br>
My silence and my cloudy melancholy,<br>
My fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls<br>
Even as an adder when she doth unroll<br>
To do some fatal execution?<br>
No, madam, these are no venereal signs:<br>
Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand,<br>
Blood and revenge are hammering in my head.<br>
Hark Tamora, the empress of my soul,<br>
Which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee,<br>
This is the day of doom for Bassianus: <br>
His Philomel must lose her tongue to-day,<br>
Thy sons make pillage of her chastity<br>
And wash their hands in Bassianus' blood.<br>
Seest thou this letter? take it up, I pray thee,<br>
And give the king this fatal plotted scroll. <br>
Now question me no more; we are espied;<br>
Here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty,<br>
Which dreads not yet their lives' destruction.
