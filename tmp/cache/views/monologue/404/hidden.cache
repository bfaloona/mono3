          And why not death rather than living torment?<br>
To die is to be banish'd from myself;<br>
And Silvia is myself: banish'd from her<br>
Is self from self: a deadly banishment!<br>
What light is light, if Silvia be not seen?<br>
What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by?<br>
Unless it be to think that she is by<br>
And feed upon the shadow of perfection <br>
Except I be by Silvia in the night,<br>
There is no music in the nightingale;<br>
Unless I look on Silvia in the day,<br>
There is no day for me to look upon;<br>
She is my essence, and I leave to be, <br>
If I be not by her fair influence<br>
Foster'd, illumined, cherish'd, kept alive.<br>
I fly not death, to fly his deadly doom:<br>
Tarry I here, I but attend on death:<br>
But, fly I hence, I fly away from life.
