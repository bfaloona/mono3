          <b>Casca.</b> Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth<br>
 Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero, <br>
 I have seen tempests, when the scolding winds<br>
 Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen<br>
 The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam,<br>
 To be exalted with the threatening clouds:<br>
 But never till to-night, never till now,<br>
 Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.<br>
 Either there is a civil strife in heaven,<br>
 Or else the world, too saucy with the gods,<br>
 Incenses them to send destruction. <br>
<br>
<del><b>Cicero.</b> Why, saw you any thing more wonderful? <br></del>
<br>
<b>Casca.</b> A common slave—you know him well by sight—<br>
 Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn<br>
 Like twenty torches join'd, and yet his hand,<br>
 Not sensible of fire, remain'd unscorch'd.<br>
 Besides—I ha' not since put up my sword— <br>
 Against the Capitol I met a lion,<br>
 Who glared upon me, and went surly by,<br>
 Without annoying me: and there were drawn<br>
 Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women,<br>
 Transformed with their fear; who swore they saw <br>
 Men all in fire walk up and down the streets.<br>
 And yesterday the bird of night did sit<br>
 Even at noon-day upon the market-place,<br>
 Hooting and shrieking. When these prodigies<br>
 Do so conjointly meet, let not men say <br>
 'These are their reasons; they are natural;'<br>
 For, I believe, they are portentous things<br>
 Unto the climate that they point upon.
