          Well, Brutus, thou art noble; yet, I see,<br>
Thy honourable metal may be wrought<br>
From that it is disposed: therefore it is meet<br>
That noble minds keep ever with their likes;<br>
For who so firm that cannot be seduced?<br>
Caesar doth bear me hard; but he loves Brutus:<br>
If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius, <br>
He should not humour me. I will this night,<br>
In several hands, in at his windows throw,<br>
As if they came from several citizens,<br>
Writings all tending to the great opinion<br>
That Rome holds of his name; wherein obscurely <br>
Caesar's ambition shall be glanced at:<br>
And after this let Caesar seat him sure;<br>
For we will shake him, or worse days endure.
