          Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;<br>
To lie in cold obstruction and to rot;<br>
This sensible warm motion to become<br>
A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit<br>
To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside<br>
In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;<br>
To be imprison'd in the viewless winds,<br>
And blown with restless violence round about<br>
The pendent world; or to be worse than worst<br>
Of those that lawless and incertain thought<br>
Imagine howling: 'tis too horrible!<br>
The weariest and most loathed worldly life<br>
That age, ache, penury and imprisonment<br>
Can lay on nature is a paradise<br>
To what we fear of death. <br>
