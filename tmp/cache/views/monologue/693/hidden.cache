           Hear me, grave fathers! noble tribunes, stay!<br>
For pity of mine age, whose youth was spent<br>
In dangerous wars, whilst you securely slept;<br>
For all my blood in Rome's great quarrel shed;<br>
For all the frosty nights that I have watch'd; <br>
And for these bitter tears, which now you see<br>
Filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks;<br>
Be pitiful to my condemned sons,<br>
Whose souls are not corrupted as 'tis thought.<br>
For two and twenty sons I never wept, <br>
Because they died in honour's lofty bed.<br>
<i>[Lieth down; the Judges, &c., pass by him, and Exeunt]</i><br>
For these, these, tribunes, in the dust I write<br>
My heart's deep languor and my soul's sad tears:<br>
Let my tears stanch the earth's dry appetite; <br>
My sons' sweet blood will make it shame and blush.<br>
O earth, I will befriend thee more with rain,<br>
That shall distil from these two ancient urns,<br>
Than youthful April shall with all his showers:<br>
In summer's drought I'll drop upon thee still;<br>
In winter with warm tears I'll melt the snow<br>
And keep eternal spring-time on thy face,<br>
So thou refuse to drink my dear sons' blood.<br>
<i>[Enter LUCIUS, with his sword drawn]</i><br>
O reverend tribunes! O gentle, aged men! <br>
Unbind my sons, reverse the doom of death;<br>
And let me say, that never wept before,<br>
My tears are now prevailing orators.
