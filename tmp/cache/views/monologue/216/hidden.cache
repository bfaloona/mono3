      <div class="monologue_preview">
          So shaken as we are, so wan with care,<br>
Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,<br>
And breathe short-winded accents of new broils<br>
To be commenced in strands afar remote.<br>
No more the thirsty entrance of this soil<br>
Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood;<br>
Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields,<br>
Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs<br>
Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes,<br>
Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,<br>
All of one nature, of one substance bred,<br>
Did lately meet in the intestine shock<br>
And furious close of civil butchery<br>
Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks, <br>
March all one way and be no more opposed<br>
Against acquaintance, kindred and allies:<br>
The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,<br>
No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,<br>
As far as to the sepulchre of Christ, <br>
Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross<br>
We are impressed and engaged to fight,<br>
Forthwith a power of English shall we levy;<br>
Whose arms were moulded in their mothers' womb<br>
To chase these pagans in those holy fields <br>
Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet<br>
Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd<br>
For our advantage on the bitter cross.<br>
But this our purpose now is twelve month old,<br>
And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go: <br>
Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear<br>
Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,<br>
What yesternight our council did decree<br>
In forwarding this dear expedience. <br>
