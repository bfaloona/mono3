          <b>Calpurnia.</b> Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies,<br>
 Yet now they fright me. There is one within,<br>
 Besides the things that we have heard and seen,<br>
 Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.<br>
 A lioness hath whelped in the streets;<br>
 And graves have yawn'd, and yielded up their dead;<br>
 Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds,<br>
 In ranks and squadrons and right form of war, <br>
 Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol;<br>
 The noise of battle hurtled in the air,<br>
 Horses did neigh, and dying men did groan,<br>
 And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.<br>
 O Caesar! these things are beyond all use, <br>
 And I do fear them.
