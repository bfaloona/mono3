          Well, come, my Kate; we will unto your father's<br>
Even in these honest mean habiliments;<br>
Our purses shall be proud, our garments poor;<br>
For 'tis the mind that makes the body rich;<br>
And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds,<br>
So honour peereth in the meanest habit.<br>
What, is the jay more precious than the lark<br>
Because his feathers are more beautiful?<br>
Or is the adder better than the eel<br>
Because his painted skin contents the eye?<br>
O no, good Kate; neither art thou the worse<br>
For this poor furniture and mean array.<br>
If thou account'st it shame, lay it on me; <br>
And therefore frolic; we will hence forthwith<br>
To feast and sport us at thy father's house.<br>
Go call my men, and let us straight to him;<br>
And bring our horses unto Long-lane end;<br>
There will we mount, and thither walk on foot.<br>
Let's see; I think 'tis now some seven o'clock,<br>
And well we may come there by dinner-time.
