      <div class="monologue_preview">
          Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again. <br>
      I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,<br>
      That almost freezes up the heat of life:<br>
      I'll call them back again to comfort me:<br>
      Nurse! What should she do here?<br>
      My dismal scene I needs must act alone.<br>
      Come, vial.<br>
      What if this mixture do not work at all?<br>
      Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?<br>
      No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.<br>
      <i>[Laying down her dagger]</i><br> 
      What if it be a poison, which the friar<br>
      Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,<br>
      Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,<br>
      Because he married me before to Romeo?<br>
      I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,<br>
      For he hath still been tried a holy man.<br>
      How if, when I am laid into the tomb,<br>
      I wake before the time that Romeo<br>
      Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!<br>
      Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,<br>
      To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,<br>
      And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?<br>
      Or, if I live, is it not very like,<br>
      The horrible conceit of death and night,<br>
      Together with the terror of the place,. <br>
      As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,<br>
      Where, for these many hundred years, the bones<br>
      Of all my buried ancestors are packed:<br>
      Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,<br>
      Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,<br>
      At some hours in the night spirits resort;.<br>
      Alack, alack, is it not like that I,<br>
      So early waking, what with loathsome smells,<br>
      And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,<br>
      That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:. <br>
      O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,<br>
      Environed with all these hideous fears?<br>
      And madly play with my forefather's joints?<br>
      And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?<br>
      And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,<br>
      As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?<br>
      O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost<br>
      Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body<br>
      Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!<br>
      Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.<br><br>
