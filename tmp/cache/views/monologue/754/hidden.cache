          Hard to seem won: but I was won, my lord,<br>
With the first glance that ever—pardon me—<br>
If I confess much, you will play the tyrant.<br>
I love you now; but not, till now, so much<br>
But I might master it: in faith, I lie;<br>
My thoughts were like unbridled children, grown<br>
Too headstrong for their mother. See, we fools!<br>
Why have I blabb'd? who shall be true to us,<br>
When we are so unsecret to ourselves? <br>
But, though I loved you well, I woo'd you not;<br>
And yet, good faith, I wish'd myself a man,<br>
Or that we women had men's privilege<br>
Of speaking first. Sweet, bid me hold my tongue,<br>
For in this rapture I shall surely speak <br>
The thing I shall repent. See, see, your silence,<br>
Cunning in dumbness, from my weakness draws<br>
My very soul of counsel! stop my mouth.
