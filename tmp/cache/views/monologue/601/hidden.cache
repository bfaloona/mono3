          <b>Tullus Aufidius.</b> <del>O CORIOLANUS, CORIOLANUS!</del><br>
 Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart<br>
 A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter <br>
 Should from yond cloud speak divine things,<br>
 And say 'Tis true,' I'ld not believe them more<br>
 Than thee, all noble CORIOLANUS. Let me twine<br>
 Mine arms about that body, where against<br>
 My grained ash an hundred times hath broke <br>
 And scarr'd the moon with splinters: here I clip<br>
 The anvil of my sword, and do contest<br>
 As hotly and as nobly with thy love<br>
 As ever in ambitious strength I did<br>
 Contend against thy valour. Know thou first, <br>
 I loved the maid I married; never man<br>
 Sigh'd truer breath; but that I see thee here,<br>
 Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart<br>
 Than when I first my wedded mistress saw<br>
 Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars! I tell thee, <br>
 We have a power on foot; and I had purpose<br>
 Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,<br>
 Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me out<br>
 Twelve several times, and I have nightly since<br>
 Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me; <br>
 We have been down together in my sleep,<br>
 Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat,<br>
 And waked half dead with nothing. Worthy CORIOLANUS,<br>
 Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that<br>
 Thou art thence banish'd, we would muster all <br>
 From twelve to seventy, and pouring war<br>
 Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,<br>
 Like a bold flood o'er-bear. O, come, go in,<br>
 And take our friendly senators by the hands;<br>
 Who now are here, taking their leaves of me, <br>
 Who am prepared against your territories,<br>
 Though not for Rome itself. <br>
<br>
<del><b>Coriolanus.</b> You bless me, gods!</del><br>
<br>
<b>Tullus Aufidius.</b> Therefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt have<br>
 The leading of thine own revenges, take <br>
 The one half of my commission; and set downâ€”<br>
 As best thou art experienced, since thou know'st<br>
 Thy country's strength and weakness,â€”thine own ways;<br>
 Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,<br>
 Or rudely visit them in parts remote, <br>
 To fright them, ere destroy. But come in:<br>
 Let me commend thee first to those that shall<br>
 Say yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!<br>
 And more a friend than e'er an enemy;<br>
 Yet, CORIOLANUS, that was much. Your hand: most welcome!
