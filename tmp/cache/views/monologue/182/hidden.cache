          <b>Borachio.</b> Seest thou not, I say, what a deformed thief this
      fashion is? how giddily a' turns about all the hot 
      bloods between fourteen and five-and-thirty?
      sometimes fashioning them like Pharaoh's soldiers
      in the reeky painting, sometime like god Bel's
      priests in the old church-window, sometime like the
      shaven Hercules in the smirched worm-eaten tapestry,
      where his codpiece seems as massy as his club? <br><br>

<del><b>Conrade.</b> All this I see; and I see that the fashion wears
      out more apparel than the man. But art not thou
      thyself giddy with the fashion too, that thou hast
      shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion? </del><br><br>

<b>Borachio.</b> Not so, neither: but know that I have to-night
      wooed Margaret, the Lady Hero's gentlewoman, by the
      name of Hero: she leans me out at her mistress'
      chamber-window, bids me a thousand times good
      night,.I tell this tale vilely:.I should first 
      tell thee how the prince, Claudio and my master,
      planted and placed and possessed by my master Don
      John, saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter. <br><br>

<del><b>Conrade.</b> And thought they Margaret was Hero?</del><br><br> 

<b>Borachio.</b> Two of them did, the prince and Claudio; but the 
      devil my master knew she was Margaret; and partly
      by his oaths, which first possessed them, partly by
      the dark night, which did deceive them, but chiefly
      by my villany, which did confirm any slander that
      Don John had made, away went Claudio enraged; swore 
      he would meet her, as he was appointed, next morning
      at the temple, and there, before the whole
      congregation, shame her with what he saw o'er night
      and send her home again without a husband.
