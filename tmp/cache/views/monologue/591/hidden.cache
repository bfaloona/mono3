          <b>Menenius Agrippa.</b> I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that<br>
 loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying<br>
 Tiber in't; said to be something imperfect in<br>
 favouring the first complaint; hasty and tinder-like<br>
 upon too trivial motion; one that converses more <br>
 with the buttock of the night than with the forehead<br>
 of the morning: what I think I utter, and spend my<br>
 malice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen as<br>
 you areâ€”I cannot call you Lycurgusesâ€”if the drink<br>
 you give me touch my palate adversely, I make a <br>
 crooked face at it. I can't say your worships have<br>
 delivered the matter well, when I find the ass in<br>
 compound with the major part of your syllables: and<br>
 though I must be content to bear with those that say<br>
 you are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that <br>
 tell you you have good faces. If you see this in<br>
 the map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known<br>
 well enough too? what barm can your bisson<br>
 conspectuities glean out of this character, if I be<br>
 known well enough too? <br>
<br>
<del><b>Junius Brutus.</b> Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.</del> <br>
<br>
<b>Menenius Agrippa.</b> You know neither me, yourselves nor any thing. You<br>
 are ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs: you<br>
 wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a<br>
 cause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller; <br>
 and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a<br>
 second day of audience. When you are hearing a<br>
 matter between party and party, if you chance to be<br>
 pinched with the colic, you make faces like<br>
 mummers; set up the bloody flag against all <br>
 patience; and, in roaring for a chamber-pot,<br>
 dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled<br>
 by your hearing: all the peace you make in their<br>
 cause is, calling both the parties knaves. You are<br>
 a pair of strange ones. <br>
<br>
<del><b>Junius Brutus.</b> Come, come, you are well understood to be a<br>
 perfecter giber for the table than a necessary<br>
 bencher in the Capitol. </del><br>
<br>
<b>Menenius Agrippa.</b> Our very priests must become mockers, if they shall<br>
 encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When <br>
 you speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth the<br>
 wagging of your beards; and your beards deserve not<br>
 so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's<br>
 cushion, or to be entombed in an ass's pack-<br>
 saddle. Yet you must be saying, CORIOLANUS is proud;<br>
 who in a cheap estimation, is worth predecessors<br>
 since Deucalion, though peradventure some of the<br>
 best of 'em were hereditary hangmen. God-den to<br>
 your worships: more of your conversation would<br>
 infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly <br>
 plebeians: I will be bold to take my leave of you.
