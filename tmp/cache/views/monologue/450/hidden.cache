          Where is Montjoy the herald? speed him hence:<br>
Let him greet England with our sharp defiance.<br>
Up, princes! and, with spirit of honour edged<br>
More sharper than your swords, hie to the field:<br>
Charles Delabreth, high constable of France; <br>
You Dukes of Orleans, Bourbon, and of Berri,<br>
Alencon, Brabant, Bar, and Burgundy;<br>
Jaques Chatillon, Rambures, Vaudemont,<br>
Beaumont, Grandpre, Roussi, and Fauconberg,<br>
Foix, Lestrale, Bouciqualt, and Charolois; <br>
High dukes, great princes, barons, lords and knights,<br>
For your great seats now quit you of great shames.<br>
Bar Harry England, that sweeps through our land<br>
With pennons painted in the blood of Harfleur:<br>
Rush on his host, as doth the melted snow <br>
Upon the valleys, whose low vassal seat<br>
The Alps doth spit and void his rheum upon:<br>
Go down upon him, you have power enough,<br>
And in a captive chariot into Rouen<br>
Bring him our prisoner.
