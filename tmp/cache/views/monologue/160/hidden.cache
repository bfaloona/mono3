          They shall, Nerissa; but in such a habit,<br>
That they shall think we are accomplished<br>
With that we lack. I'll hold thee any wager,<br>
When we are both accoutred like young men,<br>
I'll prove the prettier fellow of the two,<br>
And wear my dagger with the braver grace,<br>
And speak between the change of man and boy<br>
With a reed voice, and turn two mincing steps<br>
Into a manly stride, and speak of frays<br>
Like a fine bragging youth, and tell quaint lies,<br>
How honourable ladies sought my love,<br>
Which I denying, they fell sick and died;<br>
I could not do withal; then I'll repent,<br>
And wish for all that, that I had not killed them;<br>
And twenty of these puny lies I'll tell,<br>
That men shall swear I have discontinued school<br>
Above a twelvemonth. I have within my mind<br>
A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks,<br>
Which I will practise. <br>
