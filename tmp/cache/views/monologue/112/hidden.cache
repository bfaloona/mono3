          I did not take my leave of him, but had	 <br>
Most pretty things to say; ere I could tell him <br> 
How I would think on him at certain hours <br>
Such thoughts and such, or I could make him swear<br>
The shes of Italy should not betray <br>
Mine interest and his honour, or have charg'd him,<br> 
At the sixth hour of morn, at noon, at midnight, <br>
To encounter me with orisons, for then  <br>
I am in heaven for him; or ere I could	  <br>
Give him that parting kiss which I had set <br>
Betwixt two charming words, comes in my father,<br> 
And like the tyrannous breathing of the north <br>
Shakes all our buds from growing.<br>
