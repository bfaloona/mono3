          <b>Quince.</b> If we offend, it is with our good will.<br>
      That you should think, we come not to offend,<br>
      But with good will. To show our simple skill,<br>
      That is the true beginning of our end.<br>
      Consider then we come but in despite. <br>
      We do not come as minding to contest you,<br>
      Our true intent is. All for your delight<br>
      We are not here. That you should here repent you,<br>
      The actors are at hand and by their show<br>
      You shall know all that you are like to know. <br><br>

<del><b>Theseus.</b> This fellow doth not stand upon points. <br><br>

<b>Lysander.</b> He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt; he knows<br>
      not the stop. A good moral, my lord: it is not<br>
      enough to speak, but to speak true. <br><br>

<b>Hippolyta.</b> Indeed he hath played on his prologue like a child <br>
      on a recorder; a sound, but not in government. <br><br>

<b>Theseus.</b> His speech, was like a tangled chain; nothing<br>
      impaired, but all disordered. Who is next? </del><br><br>

[Enter Pyramus and Thisbe, Wall, Moonshine, and Lion]<br><br>

<b>Quince.</b> Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show;<br>
      But wonder on, till truth make all things plain.<br>
      This man is Pyramus, if you would know;<br>
      This beauteous lady Thisby is certain.<br>
      This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present<br>
      Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder; <br>
      And through Wall's chink, poor souls, they are content<br>
      To whisper. At the which let no man wonder.<br>
      This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,<br>
      Presenteth Moonshine; for, if you will know,<br>
      By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn<br>
      To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo.<br>
      This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name,<br>
      The trusty Thisby, coming first by night,<br>
      Did scare away, or rather did affright;<br>
      And, as she fled, her mantle she did fall, <br>
      Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.<br>
      Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,<br>
      And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain:<br>
      Whereat, with blade, with bloody blameful blade,<br>
      He bravely broach'd is boiling bloody breast;<br>
      And Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade,<br>
      His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,<br>
      Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain<br>
      At large discourse, while here they do remain.
