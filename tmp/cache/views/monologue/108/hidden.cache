          Sweet mistress,'what your name is else, I know not,<br>
  Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine,'  <br>
Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not<br> 
  Than our earth's wonder; more than earth divine.  <br>
Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak: <br>
  Lay open to my earthy-gross conceit, <br>
Smother'd in errors, feeble, shallow, weak, <br>
  The folded meaning of your words' deceit.  <br>
Against my soul's pure truth why labour you   <br>
  To make it wander in an unknown field?<br>
Are you a god? would you create me new? <br>
  Transform me then, and to your power I'll yield. <br>
But if that I am I, then well I know <br>
  Your weeping sister is no wife of mine,<br>
Nor to her bed no homage do I owe: <br>
  Far more, far more, to you do I decline.<br> 
O! train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note, <br>
  To drown me in thy sister flood of tears: <br>
Sing, siren, for thyself, and I will dote: <br>
  Spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs, <br>
And as a bed I'll take them and there lie; <br>
  And, in that glorious supposition think <br>
He gains by death that hath such means to die: <br>  
Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!<br>
