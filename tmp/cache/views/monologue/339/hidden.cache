          Great king,<br>
Few love to hear the sins they love to act;<br>
'Twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it.<br>
Who has a book of all that monarchs do,<br>
He's more secure to keep it shut than shown:<br>
For vice repeated is like the wandering wind.<br>
Blows dust in other's eyes, to spread itself;<br>
And yet the end of all is bought thus dear,<br>
The breath is gone, and the sore eyes see clear:<br>
To stop the air would hurt them. The blind mole casts<br>
Copp'd hills towards heaven, to tell the earth is throng'd <br>
By man's oppression; and the poor worm doth die for't.<br>
Kings are earth's gods; in vice their law's
their will;<br>
And if Jove stray, who dares say Jove doth ill?<br>
It is enough you know; and it is fit, <br>
What being more known grows worse, to smother it.<br>
All love the womb that their first being bred,<br>
Then give my tongue like leave to love my head.
