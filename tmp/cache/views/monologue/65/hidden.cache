      Which by us shall blessed be;<br>
      And the issue there create<br>
      Ever shall be fortunate.<br>
      So shall all the couples three<br>
      Ever true in loving be;<br>
      And the blots of Nature's hand<br>
      Shall not in their issue stand;<br>
      Never mole, hare lip, nor scar,<br>
      Nor mark prodigious, such as are<br>
      Despised in nativity,<br>
      Shall upon their children be.<br>
      With this field-dew consecrate,<br>
      Every fairy take his gait;<br>
      And each several chamber bless,<br>
      Through this palace, with sweet peace;<br>
      And the owner of it blest <br>
      Ever shall in safety rest.<br>
      Trip away; make no stay;<br>
      Meet me all by break of day.<br><br>
