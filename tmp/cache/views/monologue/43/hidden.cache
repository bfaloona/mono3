      <div class="monologue_preview">
          My mistress with a monster is in love.<br>
Near to her close and consecrated bower,<br>
While she was in her dull and sleeping hour,<br>
A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,<br>
That work for bread upon Athenian stalls,<br>
Were met together to rehearse a play<br>
Intended for great Theseus' nuptial-day.<br>
The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort,<br>
Who Pyramus presented, in their sport<br>
Forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake <br>
When I did him at this advantage take,<br>
An ass's nole I fixed on his head:<br>
Anon his Thisbe must be answered,<br>
And forth my mimic comes. When they him spy,<br>
As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye, <br>
Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort,<br>
Rising and cawing at the gun's report,<br>
Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky,<br>
So, at his sight, away his fellows fly;<br>
And, at our stamp, here o'er and o'er one falls;<br>
He murder cries and help from Athens calls.<br>
Their sense thus weak, lost with their fears
thus strong,<br>
Made senseless things begin to do them wrong;<br>
For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch;<br>
Some sleeves, some hats, from yielders all
things catch.<br>
I led them on in this distracted fear,<br>
And left sweet Pyramus translated there:<br>
When in that moment, so it came to pass, <br>
Titania waked and straightway loved an ass.
