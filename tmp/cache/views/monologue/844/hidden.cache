          Since what I am to say must be but that<br>
Which contradicts my accusation and <br>
The testimony on my part no other<br>
But what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me<br>
To say 'not guilty:' mine integrity<br>
Being counted falsehood, shall, as I express it,<br>
Be so received. But thus: if powers divine<br>
Behold our human actions, as they do,<br>
I doubt not then but innocence shall make<br>
False accusation blush and tyranny<br>
Tremble at patience. You, my lord, best know,<br>
Who least will seem to do so, my past life<br>
Hath been as continent, as chaste, as true,<br>
As I am now unhappy; which is more<br>
Than history can pattern, though devised<br>
And play'd to take spectators. For behold me<br>
A fellow of the royal bed, which owe <br>
A moiety of the throne a great king's daughter,<br>
The mother to a hopeful prince, here standing<br>
To prate and talk for life and honour 'fore<br>
Who please to come and hear. For life, I prize it<br>
As I weigh grief, which I would spare: for honour, <br>
'Tis a derivative from me to mine,<br>
And only that I stand for. I appeal<br>
To your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes<br>
Came to your court, how I was in your grace,<br>
How merited to be so; since he came, <br>
With what encounter so uncurrent I<br>
Have strain'd to appear thus: if one jot beyond<br>
The bound of honour, or in act or will<br>
That way inclining, harden'd be the hearts<br>
Of all that hear me, and my near'st of kin <br>
Cry fie upon my grave!
