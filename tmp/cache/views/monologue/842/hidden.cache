          <b>Hermione.</b> There's some ill planet reigns:<br>
 I must be patient till the heavens look<br>
 With an aspect more favourable. Good my lords,<br>
 I am not prone to weeping, as our sex<br>
 Commonly are; the want of which vain dew<br>
 Perchance shall dry your pities: but I have<br>
 That honourable grief lodged here which burns<br>
 Worse than tears drown: beseech you all, my lords,<br>
 With thoughts so qualified as your charities<br>
 Shall best instruct you, measure me; and so<br>
 The king's will be perform'd!<br>
<br>
<del><b>Leontes.</b> Shall I be heard? </del><br>
<br>
<b>Hermione.</b> Who is't that goes with me? Beseech your highness,<br>
 My women may be with me; for you see<br>
 My plight requires it. Do not weep, good fools;<br>
 There is no cause: when you shall know your mistress 740<br>
 Has deserved prison, then abound in tears<br>
 As I come out: this action I now go on<br>
 Is for my better grace. Adieu, my lord:<br>
 I never wish'd to see you sorry; now<br>
 I trust I shall. My women, come; you have leave.
