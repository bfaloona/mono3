          You are three men of sin, whom Destiny,<br>
That hath to instrument this lower world <br>
And what is in't, the never-surfeited sea<br>
Hath caused to belch up you; and on this island<br>
Where man doth not inhabit; you 'mongst men<br>
Being most unfit to live. I have made you mad;<br>
And even with such-like valour men hang and drown <br>
Their proper selves.<br>
<i>[ALONSO, SEBASTIAN &c. draw their swords]</i><br>
You fools! I and my fellows<br>
Are ministers of Fate: the elements,<br>
Of whom your swords are temper'd, may as well <br>
Wound the loud winds, or with bemock'd-at stabs<br>
Kill the still-closing waters, as diminish<br>
One dowle that's in my plume: my fellow-ministers<br>
Are like invulnerable. If you could hurt,<br>
Your swords are now too massy for your strengths <br>
And will not be uplifted. But remember—<br>
For that's my business to you—that you three<br>
From Milan did supplant good Prospero;<br>
Exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it,<br>
Him and his innocent child: for which foul deed <br>
The powers, delaying, not forgetting, have<br>
Incensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures,<br>
Against your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso,<br>
They have bereft; and do pronounce by me:<br>
Lingering perdition, worse than any death <br>
Can be at once, shall step by step attend<br>
You and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from—<br>
Which here, in this most desolate isle, else falls<br>
Upon your heads—is nothing but heart-sorrow<br>
And a clear life ensuing. <br>
