          O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;<br>
It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,<br>
A brother's murther! Pray can I not, <br>
Though inclination be as sharp as will.<br>
My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,<br>
And, like a man to double business bound,<br>
I stand in pause where I shall first begin,<br>
And both neglect. What if this cursed hand <br>
Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,<br>
Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens<br>
To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy<br>
But to confront the visage of offence?<br>
And what's in prayer but this twofold force,<br>
To be forestalled ere we come to fall,<br>
Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;<br>
My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer<br>
Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murther'?<br>
That cannot be; since I am still possess'd <br>
Of those effects for which I did the murther-<br>
My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.<br>
May one be pardon'd and retain th' offence?<br>
In the corrupted currents of this world<br>
Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,<br>
And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself<br>
Buys out the law; but 'tis not so above.<br>
There is no shuffling; there the action lies<br>
In his true nature, and we ourselves compell'd,<br>
Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults, <br>
To give in evidence. What then? What rests?<br>
Try what repentance can. What can it not?<br>
Yet what can it when one cannot repent?<br>
O wretched state! O bosom black as death!<br>
O limed soul, that, struggling to be free, <br>
Art more engag'd! Help, angels! Make assay.<br>
Bow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel,<br>
Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe!<br>
All may be well. He kneels. <br>
