          <b>Gertrude.</b> One woe doth tread upon another's heel,<br>
      So fast they follow. Your sister's drown'd, Laertes. <br><br>

<del><b>Laertes.</b>Drown'd! O, where?</del><br><br>

<b>Gertrude.</b> There is a willow grows aslant a brook,<br>
      That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream.<br>
      There with fantastic garlands did she come<br>
      Of crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,<br>
      That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,<br>
      But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them.<br>
      There on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds<br>
      Clamb'ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,<br>
      When down her weedy trophies and herself<br>
      Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide<br>
      And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up; <br>
      Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,<br>
      As one incapable of her own distress,<br>
      Or like a creature native and indued<br>
      Unto that element; but long it could not be<br>
      Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,<br>
      Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay<br>
      To muddy death.
