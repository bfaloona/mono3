      <div class="monologue_preview">
          Fie, fie! unknit that threatening unkind brow,<br>
And dart not scornful glances from those eyes <br>
To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor.<br>
It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,<br>
Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,<br>
And in no sense is meet or amiable.<br>
A woman mov'd is like a fountain troubled-<br>
Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty;<br>
And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty<br>
Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.<br>
Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,<br>
Thy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee, <br>
And for thy maintenance commits his body<br>
To painful labour both by sea and land,<br>
To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,<br>
Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe;<br>
And craves no other tribute at thy hands<br>
But love, fair looks, and true obedience-<br>
Too little payment for so great a debt.<br>
Such duty as the subject owes the prince,<br>
Even such a woman oweth to her husband;<br>
And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,<br>
And not obedient to his honest will,<br>
What is she but a foul contending rebel<br>
And graceless traitor to her loving lord?<br>
I am asham'd that women are so simple<br>
To offer war where they should kneel for peace;<br>
Or seek for rule, supremacy, and sway,<br>
When they are bound to serve, love, and obey.<br>
Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,<br>
Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,<br>
But that our soft conditions and our hearts<br>
Should well agree with our external parts?<br>
Come, come, you forward and unable worms!<br>
My mind hath been as big as one of yours,<br>
My heart as great, my reason haply more,<br>
To bandy word for word and frown for frown; <br>
But now I see our lances are but straws,<br>
Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,<br>
That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.<br>
Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,<br>
And place your hands below your husband's foot;<br>
In token of which duty, if he please,<br>
My hand is ready, may it do him ease.
