          You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand,<br>
Such as I am: though for myself alone<br>
I would not be ambitious in my wish,<br>
To wish myself much better; yet, for you<br>
I would be trebled twenty times myself;<br>
A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich;<br>
That only to stand high in your account, <br>
I might in virtue, beauties, livings, friends,<br>
Exceed account; but the full sum of me<br>
Is sum of something, which, to term in gross,<br>
Is an unlesson'd girl, unschool'd, unpractised;<br>
Happy in this, she is not yet so old<br>
But she may learn; happier than this,<br>
She is not bred so dull but she can learn;<br>
Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit<br>
Commits itself to yours to be directed,<br>
As from her lord, her governor, her king.<br>
Myself and what is mine to you and yours<br>
Is now converted: but now I was the lord<br>
Of this fair mansion, master of my servants,<br>
Queen o'er myself: and even now, but now,<br>
This house, these servants and this same myself<br>
Are yours, my lord: I give them with this ring;<br>
Which when you part from, lose, or give away,<br>
Let it presage the ruin of your love<br>
And be my vantage to exclaim on you. <br>
