          Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;<br>
Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink<br>
How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal<br>
Your high displeasure: all this uttered<br>
With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,<br>
Could not take truce with the unruly spleen<br>
Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts <br>
With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,<br>
Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,<br>
And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats<br>
Cold death aside, and with the other sends<br>
It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity, <br>
Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,<br>
'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than
his tongue,<br>
His agile arm beats down their fatal points,<br>
And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm <br>
An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life<br>
Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;<br>
But by and by comes back to Romeo,<br>
Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,<br>
And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I <br>
Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.<br>
And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.<br>
This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
