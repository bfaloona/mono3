          Now the hungry lion roars, <br>
And the wolf behowls the moon;<br>
Whilst the heavy ploughman snores,<br>
All with weary task fordone.<br>
Now the wasted brands do glow,<br>
Whilst the screech-owl, screeching loud,<br>
Puts the wretch that lies in woe<br>
In remembrance of a shroud.<br>
Now it is the time of night<br>
That the graves all gaping wide,<br>
Every one lets forth his sprite, <br>
In the church-way paths to glide:<br>
And we fairies, that do run<br>
By the triple Hecate's team,<br>
From the presence of the sun,<br>
Following darkness like a dream, <br>
Now are frolic: not a mouse<br>
Shall disturb this hallow'd house:<br>
I am sent with broom before,<br>
To sweep the dust behind the door.
