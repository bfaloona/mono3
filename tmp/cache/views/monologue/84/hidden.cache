          I would I had that corporal soundness now,<br> 
As when thy father and myself in friendship<br>
First tried our soldiership! He did look far<br> 
Into the service of the time and was<br>
Discipled of the bravest: he lasted long;<br>
But on us both did haggish age steal on<br>
And wore us out of act. It much repairs me<br>
To talk of your good father. In his youth<br>
He had the wit which I can well observe<br>
To-day in our young lords; but they may jest<br>
Till their own scorn return to them unnoted<br>
Ere they can hide their levity in honour;<br>
So like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness<br>
Were in his pride or sharpness; if they were,<br>
His equal had awaked them, and his honour,<br>
Clock to itself, knew the true minute when<br>
Exception bid him speak, and at this time<br>
His tongue obey'd his hand: who were below him<br>
He used as creatures of another place<br>
And bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks,<br>
Making them proud of his humility,<br>
In their poor praise he humbled.<br>
Such a man Might be a copy to these younger times;<br>
Which, follow'd well, would demonstrate them now<br>
But goers backward.
