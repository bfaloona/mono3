          O, the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us!<br>
Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt,<br>
Since riches point to misery and contempt?<br>
Who would be so mock'd with glory? or to live<br>
But in a dream of friendship? <br>
To have his pomp and all what state compounds<br>
But only painted, like his varnish'd friends?<br>
Poor honest lord, brought low by his own heart,<br>
Undone by goodness! Strange, unusual blood,<br>
When man's worst sin is, he does too much good! <br>
Who, then, dares to be half so kind again?<br>
For bounty, that makes gods, does still mar men.<br>
My dearest lord, bless'd, to be most accursed,<br>
Rich, only to be wretched, thy great fortunes<br>
Are made thy chief afflictions. Alas, kind lord! <br>
He's flung in rage from this ingrateful seat<br>
Of monstrous friends, nor has he with him to<br>
Supply his life, or that which can command it.<br>
I'll follow and inquire him out:<br>
I'll ever serve his mind with my best will; <br>
Whilst I have gold, I'll be his steward still.
