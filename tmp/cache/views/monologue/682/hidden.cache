          I am sick of this false world, and will love nought<br>
But even the mere necessities upon 't. <br>
Then, Timon, presently prepare thy grave;<br>
Lie where the light foam the sea may beat<br>
Thy grave-stone daily: make thine epitaph,<br>
That death in me at others' lives may laugh.<br>
<i>[To the gold]</i> <br>
O thou sweet king-killer, and dear divorce<br>
'Twixt natural son and sire! thou bright defiler<br>
Of Hymen's purest bed! thou valiant Mars!<br>
Thou ever young, fresh, loved and delicate wooer,<br>
Whose blush doth thaw the consecrated snow <br>
That lies on Dian's lap! thou visible god,<br>
That solder'st close impossibilities,<br>
And makest them kiss! that speak'st with every tongue,<br>
To every purpose! O thou touch of hearts! <br>
Think, thy slave man rebels, and by thy virtue<br>
Set them into confounding odds, that beasts<br>
May have the world in empire!
