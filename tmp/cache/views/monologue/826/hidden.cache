          <div align=right>O good Iago,</div>
What shall I do to win my lord again?<br>
Good friend, go to him; for, by this light of heaven,<br>
I know not how I lost him. Here I kneel: <br>
If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love,<br>
Either in discourse of thought or actual deed,<br>
Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense,<br>
Delighted them in any other form;<br>
Or that I do not yet, and ever did. <br>
And ever will—though he do shake me off<br>
To beggarly divorcement—love him dearly,<br>
Comfort forswear me! Unkindness may do much;<br>
And his unkindness may defeat my life,<br>
But never taint my love. I cannot say 'whore:' <br>
It does abhor me now I speak the word;<br>
To do the act that might the addition earn<br>
Not the world's mass of vanity could make me. <br>
