          Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,<br>
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek <br>
For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night<br>
Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny<br>
What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!<br>
Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'<br>
And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st, <br>
Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries<br>
Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,<br>
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:<br>
Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,<br>
I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay, <br>
So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.<br>
In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,<br>
And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:<br>
But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true<br>
Than those that have more cunning to be strange. <br>
I should have been more strange, I must confess,<br>
But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,<br>
My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,<br>
And not impute this yielding to light love,<br>
Which the dark night hath so discovered.
