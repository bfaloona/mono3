          Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent<br>
To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:<br>
To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;<br>
Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:<br>
Take thou this vial, being then in bed,<br>
And this distilled liquor drink thou off; <br>
When presently through all thy veins shall run<br>
A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse<br>
Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:<br>
No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;<br>
The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade <br>
To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,<br>
Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;<br>
Each part, deprived of supple government,<br>
Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:<br>
And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death <br>
Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,<br>
And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.<br>
Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes<br>
To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:<br>
Then, as the manner of our country is, <br>
In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier<br>
Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault<br>
Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.<br>
In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,<br>
Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift, <br>
And hither shall he come: and he and I<br>
Will watch thy waking, and that very night<br>
Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.<br>
And this shall free thee from this present shame;<br>
If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,<br>
Abate thy valour in the acting it.
