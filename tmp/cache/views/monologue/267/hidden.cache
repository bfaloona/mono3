          <div align='right'>Hold thy desperate hand:</div>
Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:<br>
Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote<br>
The unreasonable fury of a beast:<br>
Unseemly woman in a seeming man!<br>
Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!<br>
Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order, <br>
I thought thy disposition better temper'd.<br>
Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?<br>
And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,<br>
By doing damned hate upon thyself?<br>
Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?<br>
Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet<br>
In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.<br>
Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;<br>
Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,<br>
And usest none in that true use indeed <br>
Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:<br>
Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,<br>
Digressing from the valour of a man;<br>
Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,<br>
Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish; <br>
Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,<br>
Misshapen in the conduct of them both,<br>
Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,<br>
Is set afire by thine own ignorance,<br>
And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.<br>
What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,<br>
For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;<br>
There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,<br>
But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too:<br>
The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend <br>
And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:<br>
A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;<br>
Happiness courts thee in her best array;<br>
But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,<br>
Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love: <br>
Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.<br>
Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,<br>
Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:<br>
But look thou stay not till the watch be set,<br>
For then thou canst not pass to Mantua; <br>
Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time<br>
To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,<br>
Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back<br>
With twenty hundred thousand times more joy<br>
Than thou went'st forth in lamentation. <br>
Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;<br>
And bid her hasten all the house to bed,<br>
Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:<br>
Romeo is coming.
