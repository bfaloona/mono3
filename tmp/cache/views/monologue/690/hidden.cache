          For shame, be friends, and join for that you jar: <br>
'Tis policy and stratagem must do<br>
That you affect; and so must you resolve,<br>
That what you cannot as you would achieve,<br>
You must perforce accomplish as you may.<br>
Take this of me: Lucrece was not more chaste <br>
Than this Lavinia, Bassianus' love.<br>
A speedier course than lingering languishment<br>
Must we pursue, and I have found the path.<br>
My lords, a solemn hunting is in hand;<br>
There will the lovely Roman ladies troop: <br>
The forest walks are wide and spacious;<br>
And many unfrequented plots there are<br>
Fitted by kind for rape and villany:<br>
Single you thither then this dainty doe,<br>
And strike her home by force, if not by words: <br>
This way, or not at all, stand you in hope.<br>
Come, come, our empress, with her sacred wit<br>
To villany and vengeance consecrate,<br>
Will we acquaint with all that we intend;<br>
And she shall file our engines with advice, <br>
That will not suffer you to square yourselves,<br>
But to your wishes' height advance you both.<br>
The emperor's court is like the house of Fame,<br>
The palace full of tongues, of eyes, and ears:<br>
The woods are ruthless, dreadful, deaf, and dull; <br>
There speak, and strike, brave boys, and take your turns;<br>
There serve your lusts, shadow'd from heaven's eye,<br>
And revel in Lavinia's treasury.
