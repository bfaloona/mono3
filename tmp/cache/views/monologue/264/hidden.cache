          He jests at scars that never felt a wound.<br>
<i>[JULIET appears above at a window]</i><br>
But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?<br>
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.<br>
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,<br>
Who is already sick and pale with grief, <br>
That thou her maid art far more fair than she:<br>
Be not her maid, since she is envious;<br>
Her vestal livery is but sick and green<br>
And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.<br>
It is my lady, O, it is my love! <br>
O, that she knew she were!<br>
She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?<br>
Her eye discourses; I will answer it.<br>
I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:<br>
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven, <br>
Having some business, do entreat her eyes<br>
To twinkle in their spheres till they return.<br>
What if her eyes were there, they in her head?<br>
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,<br>
As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven <br>
Would through the airy region stream so bright<br>
That birds would sing and think it were not night.<br>
See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!<br>
O, that I were a glove upon that hand,<br>
That I might touch that cheek!
