          <b>Horatio.</b> <div align="right">That can I.</div>
      At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,<br>
      Whose image even but now appear'd to us,<br>
      Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,<br>
      Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride, 
      Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet<br>
      (For so this side of our known world esteem'd him)<br>
      Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,<br>
      Well ratified by law and heraldry,<br>
      Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands <br>
      Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;<br>
      Against the which a moiety competent<br>
      Was gaged by our king; which had return'd<br>
      To the inheritance of Fortinbras,<br>
      Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant <br>
      And carriage of the article design'd,<br>
      His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,<br>
      Of unimproved mettle hot and full,<br>
      Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,<br>
      Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,<br>
      For food and diet, to some enterprise<br>
      That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,<br>
      As it doth well appear unto our state,<br>
      But to recover of us, by strong hand<br>
      And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands<br>
      So by his father lost; and this, I take it,<br>
      Is the main motive of our preparations,<br>
      The source of this our watch, and the chief head<br>
      Of this post-haste and romage in the land. <br><br>

<del><b>Bernardo.</b> I think it be no other but e'en so.<br>
      Well may it sort that this portentous figure<br>
      Comes armed through our watch, so like the King<br>
      That was and is the question of these wars. </del><br><br>

<B>Horatio.</b> A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.<br>
      In the most high and palmy state of Rome, <br>
      A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,<br>
      The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead<br>
      Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;<br>
      As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,<br>
      Disasters in the sun; and the moist star <br>
      Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands<br>
      Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.<br>
      And even the like precurse of fierce events,<br>
      As harbingers preceding still the fates<br>
      And prologue to the omen coming on, <br>
      Have heaven and earth together demonstrated<br>
      Unto our climature and countrymen.<br>
      [<i>Enter Ghost again.</i>]<br>
      But soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again!<br>
      I'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion! <br>
      [<i>Spreads his arms.</i>]<br>
      If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,<br>
      Speak to me.<br>
      If there be any good thing to be done,<br>
      That may to thee do ease, and, grace to me,<br>
      Speak to me.<br>
      If thou art privy to thy country's fate,<br>
      Which happily foreknowing may avoid,<br>
      O, speak!<br>
      Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life <br>
      Extorted treasure in the womb of earth<br>
      (For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death),<br>
      [<i>The cock crows.</i>]<br>
      Speak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!<br>
