          How you speak!	 <br>
Did you but know the city's usuries <br>
And felt them knowingly; the art o' the court,<br>
As hard to leave as keep, whose top to climb <br>
Is certain falling, or so slippery that <br>
The fear's as bad as falling; the toil of the war,<br> 
A pain that only seems to seek out danger   <br>
I' the name of fame and honour; which dies i' the search,<br> 
And hath as oft a slanderous epitaph <br>
As record of fair act; nay, many times, <br>
Doth ill deserve by doing well; what's worse,<br>
Must curtsy at the censure: O boys! this story  <br>
The world may read in me; my body's mark'd <br>
With Roman swords, and my report was once <br>
First with the best of note; Cymbeline lov'd me,<br>
And when a soldier was the theme, my name <br>
Was not far off; then was I as a tree <br>
Whose boughs did bend with fruit, but, in one night,<br> 
A storm or robbery, call it what you will,  <br>
Shook down my mellow hangings, nay, my leaves, <br>
And left me bare to weather. <br>
  <br>
<del>Gui.        Uncertain favour!</del> <br>
<br>
Bel.  My fault being nothing,'as I have told you oft,'  <br>
But that two villains, whose false oaths prevail'd  <br>
Before my perfect honour, swore to Cymbeline <br>
I was confederate with the Romans; <br>
Follow'd my banishment, and this twenty years<br>
This rock and these demesnes have been my world,<br> 
Where I have liv'd at honest freedom, paid <br>
More pious debts to heaven than in all <br>
The fore-end of my time. But, up to the mountains! <br>
This is not hunter's language. He that strikes <br>
The venison first shall be the lord o' the feast; <br>
To him the other two shall minister; <br>
And we will fear no poison which attends  
In place of greater state. I'll meet you in the valleys.  [Exeunt GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS.] <br>
How hard it is to hide the sparks of nature! <br>
These boys know little they are sons to the king; <br>
Nor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive.  <br>
They think they are mine; and, though train'd up thus meanly<br> 
I' the cave wherein they bow, their thoughts do hit <br>
The roofs of palaces, and nature prompts them <br>
In simple and low things to prince it much  <br>
Beyond the trick of others. This Polydore,   <br>
The heir of Cymbeline and Britain, who <br>
The king his father call'd Guiderius,'Jove! <br>
When on my three-foot stool I sit and tell  <br>
The war-like feats I have done, his spirits fly out<br> 
Into my story: say, 'Thus mine enemy fell, <br>
And thus I set my foot on 's neck;' even then <br>
The princely blood flows in his cheek, he sweats, <br>
Strains his young nerves, and puts himself in posture <br>
That acts my words. The younger brother, Cadwal,' <br>
Once Arviragus,'in as like a figure, <br>
Strikes life into my speech and shows much more <br>
His own conceiving. Hark! the game is rous'd. <br>
O Cymbeline! heaven and my conscience knows <br>
Thou didst unjustly banish me; whereon, <br>
At three and two years old, I stole these babes,<br>
Thinking to bar thee of succession, as <br>
Thou reft'st me of my lands. Euriphile, <br>
Thou wast their nurse; they took thee for their mother,<br> 
And every day do honour to her grave:  <br>
Myself, Belarius, that am Morgan call'd, <br>
They take for natural father. The game is up.  [Exit.]<br>
