          You do look, my son, in a moved sort,<br>
As if you were dismay'd: be cheerful, sir.<br>
Our revels now are ended. These our actors,<br>
As I foretold you, were all spirits and <br>
Are melted into air, into thin air:<br>
And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,<br>
The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces,<br>
The solemn temples, the great globe itself,<br>
Ye all which it inherit, shall dissolve 1885<br>
And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,<br>
Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff<br>
As dreams are made on, and our little life<br>
Is rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vex'd;<br>
Bear with my weakness; my, brain is troubled: <br>
Be not disturb'd with my infirmity:<br>
If you be pleased, retire into my cell<br>
And there repose: a turn or two I'll walk,<br>
To still my beating mind.
