          This note doth tell me of ten thousand French<br>
That in the field lie slain: of princes, in this number,<br>
And nobles bearing banners, there lie dead <br>
One hundred twenty six: added to these,<br>
Of knights, esquires, and gallant gentlemen,<br>
Eight thousand and four hundred; of the which,<br>
Five hundred were but yesterday dubb'd knights:<br>
So that, in these ten thousand they have lost, <br>
There are but sixteen hundred mercenaries;<br>
The rest are princes, barons, lords, knights, squires,<br>
And gentlemen of blood and quality.<br>
The names of those their nobles that lie dead:<br>
Charles Delabreth, high constable of France; <br>
Jaques of Chatillon, admiral of France;<br>
The master of the cross-bows, Lord Rambures;<br>
Great Master of France, the brave Sir Guichard Dolphin,<br>
John Duke of Alencon, Anthony Duke of Brabant,<br>
The brother of the Duke of Burgundy, <br>
And Edward Duke of Bar: of lusty earls,<br>
Grandpre and Roussi, Fauconberg and Foix,<br>
Beaumont and Marle, Vaudemont and Lestrale.<br>
Here was a royal fellowship of death!<br>
Where is the number of our English dead?<br>
<i>[Herald shews him another paper]</i><br>
Edward the Duke of York, the Earl of Suffolk,<br>
Sir Richard Ketly, Davy Gam, esquire:<br>
None else of name; and of all other men<br>
But five and twenty. O God, thy arm was here; <br>
And not to us, but to thy arm alone,<br>
Ascribe we all! When, without stratagem,<br>
But in plain shock and even play of battle,<br>
Was ever known so great and little loss<br>
On one part and on the other? Take it, God, <br>
For it is none but thine!
