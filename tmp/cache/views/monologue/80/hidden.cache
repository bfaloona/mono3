          'Till I have no wife, I have nothing in France''<br>
Nothing in France until he has no wife!	 <br>
Thou shalt have none, Rousillon, none in France;<br> 
Then hast thou all again. Poor lord! is't I <br>
That chase thee from thy country, and expose <br>
Those tender limbs of thine to the event <br>
Of the non-sparing war? and is it I <br>
That drive thee from the sportive court, where thou<br> 
Wast shot at with fair eyes, to be the mark <br>
Of smoky muskets? O you leaden messengers, <br>
That ride upon the violent speed of fire, <br>
Fly with false aim; move the still-piecing air,<br> 
That sings with piercing; do not touch my lord!	 <br>
Whoever shoots at him, I set him there; <br>
Whoever charges on his forward breast, <br>
I am the caitiff that do hold him to 't; <br>
And, though I kill him not, I am the cause <br>
His death was so effected: better 'twere<br>
I met the ravin lion when he roar'd <br>
With sharp constraint of hunger; better 'twere<br> 
That all the miseries which nature owes	 <br>
Were mine at once. No, come thou home, Rousillon,<br>
Whence honour but of danger wins a scar, <br>
As oft it loses all: I will be gone; <br>
My being here it is that holds thee hence: <br>
Shall I stay here to do 't? no, no, although<br>
The air of paradise did fan the house, <br>
And angels offic'd all: I will be gone, <br>
That pitiful rumour may report my flight, <br>
To consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day!<br>
For with the dark, poor thief, I'll steal away.
