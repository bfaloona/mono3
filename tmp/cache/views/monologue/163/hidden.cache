          Let me play the fool:<br>
With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,<br>
And let my liver rather heat with wine<br>
Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.<br>
Why should a man, whose blood is warm within,<br>
Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster? <br>
Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice<br>
By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio.<br>
I love thee, and it is my love that speaks.<br>
There are a sort of men whose visages<br>
Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,<br>
And do a wilful stillness entertain,<br>
With purpose to be dress'd in an opinion<br>
Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,<br>
As who should say 'I am Sir Oracle,<br>
And when I ope my lips let no dog bark!'<br>
O my Antonio, I do know of these<br>
That therefore only are reputed wise<br>
For saying nothing; when, I am very sure,<br>
If they should speak, would almost damn those ears,<br>
Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.<br>
I'll tell thee more of this another time:<br>
But fish not, with this melancholy bait,<br>
For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.<br>
Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well awhile:<br>
I'll end my exhortation after dinner.
