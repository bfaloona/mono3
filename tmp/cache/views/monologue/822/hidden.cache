          I prithee, do so.<br><i>[Exit IAGO]</i><br>
Something, sure, of state, <br>
Either from Venice, or some unhatch'd practise<br>
Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,<br>
Hath puddled his clear spirit: and in such cases<br>
Men's natures wrangle with inferior things,<br>
Though great ones are their object. 'Tis even so; <br>
For let our finger ache, and it indues<br>
Our other healthful members even to that sense<br>
Of pain: nay, we must think men are not gods,<br>
Nor of them look for such observances<br>
As fit the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia,<br>
I was, unhandsome warrior as I am,<br>
Arraigning his unkindness with my soul;<br>
But now I find I had suborn'd the witness,<br>
And he's indicted falsely. <br>
