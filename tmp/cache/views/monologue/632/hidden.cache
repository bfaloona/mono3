          Thou, Nature, art my goddess; to thy law<br>
My services are bound. Wherefore should I <br>
Stand in the plague of custom, and permit<br>
The curiosity of nations to deprive me,<br>
For that I am some twelve or fourteen moonshines<br>
Lag of a brother? Why bastard? wherefore base?<br>
When my dimensions are as well compact, <br>
My mind as generous, and my shape as true,<br>
As honest madam's issue? Why brand they us<br>
With base? with baseness? bastardy? base, base?<br>
Who, in the lusty stealth of nature, take<br>
More composition and fierce quality <br>
Than doth, within a dull, stale, tired bed,<br>
Go to th' creating a whole tribe of fops<br>
Got 'tween asleep and wake? Well then,<br>
Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land.<br>
Our father's love is to the bastard Edmund <br>
As to th' legitimate. Fine word- 'legitimate'!<br>
Well, my legitimate, if this letter speed,<br>
And my invention thrive, Edmund the base<br>
Shall top th' legitimate. I grow; I prosper.<br>
Now, gods, stand up for bastards!
