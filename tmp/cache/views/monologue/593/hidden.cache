           I shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus<br>
Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held<br>
That valour is the chiefest virtue, and<br>
Most dignifies the haver: if it be,<br>
The man I speak of cannot in the world<br>
Be singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,<br>
When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought <br>
Beyond the mark of others: our then dictator,<br>
Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight,<br>
When with his Amazonian chin he drove<br>
The bristled lips before him: be bestrid<br>
An o'er-press'd Roman and i' the consul's view<br>
Slew three opposers: Tarquin's self he met,<br>
And struck him on his knee: in that day's feats,<br>
When he might act the woman in the scene,<br>
He proved best man i' the field, and for his meed<br>
Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age <br>
Man-enter'd thus, he waxed like a sea,<br>
And in the brunt of seventeen battles since<br>
He lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last,<br>
Before and in Corioli, let me say,<br>
I cannot speak him home: he stopp'd the fliers; <br>
And by his rare example made the coward<br>
Turn terror into sport: as weeds before<br>
A vessel under sail, so men obey'd<br>
And fell below his stem: his sword, death's stamp,<br>
Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot <br>
He was a thing of blood, whose every motion<br>
Was timed with dying cries: alone he enter'd<br>
The mortal gate of the city, which he painted<br>
With shunless destiny; aidless came off,<br>
And with a sudden reinforcement struck <br>
Corioli like a planet: now all's his:<br>
When, by and by, the din of war gan pierce<br>
His ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit<br>
Re-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate,<br>
And to the battle came he; where he did<br>
Run reeking o'er the lives of men, as if<br>
'Twere a perpetual spoil: and till we call'd<br>
Both field and city ours, he never stood<br>
To ease his breast with panting.
