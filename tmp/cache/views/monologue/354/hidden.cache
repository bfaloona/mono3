          <b>Ariel.</b> To every article.<br>
 I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak,<br>
 Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,<br>
 I flamed amazement: sometime I'ld divide,<br>
 And burn in many places; on the topmast,<br>
 The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,<br>
 Then meet and join. Jove's lightnings, the precursors<br>
 O' the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary<br>
 And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks<br>
 Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune<br>
 Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,<br>
 Yea, his dread trident shake. <br>
<br>
<del><b>Prospero.</b> My brave spirit!<br>
 Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil<br>
 Would not infect his reason? <br></del>
<br>
<b>Ariel.</b> Not a soul<br>
 But felt a fever of the mad and play'd <br>
 Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners<br>
 Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,<br>
 Then all afire with me: the king's son, Ferdinand,<br>
 With hair up-staring,â€”then like reeds, not hair,â€”<br>
 Was the first man that leap'd; cried, 'Hell is empty <br>
 And all the devils are here.'
