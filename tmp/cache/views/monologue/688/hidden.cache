          Hail, Rome, victorious in thy mourning weeds!<br>
Lo, as the bark, that hath discharged her fraught,<br>
Returns with precious jading to the bay<br>
From whence at first she weigh'd her anchorage,<br>
Cometh Andronicus, bound with laurel boughs, <br>
To re-salute his country with his tears,<br>
Tears of true joy for his return to Rome.<br>
Thou great defender of this Capitol,<br>
Stand gracious to the rites that we intend!<br>
Romans, of five and twenty valiant sons, <br>
Half of the number that King Priam had,<br>
Behold the poor remains, alive and dead!<br>
These that survive let Rome reward with love;<br>
These that I bring unto their latest home,<br>
With burial amongst their ancestors: <br>
Here Goths have given me leave to sheathe my sword.<br>
Titus, unkind and careless of thine own,<br>
Why suffer'st thou thy sons, unburied yet,<br>
To hover on the dreadful shore of Styx?<br>
Make way to lay them by their brethren. <br>
<i>[The tomb is opened]</i><br>
There greet in silence, as the dead are wont,<br>
And sleep in peace, slain in your country's wars!<br>
O sacred receptacle of my joys,<br>
Sweet cell of virtue and nobility, <br>
How many sons of mine hast thou in store,<br>
That thou wilt never render to me more!
