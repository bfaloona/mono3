          Now, out of doubt, Antipholus is mad,<br>
Else would he never so demean himself.<br>  
A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats,<br>
And for the same he promis'd me a chain: <br>
Both one and other he denies me now. <br>
The reason that I gather he is mad, <br>
Besides this present instance of his rage,<br> 
Is a mad tale he told to-day at dinner, <br>
Of his own doors being shut against his entrance.<br>
Belike his wife, acquainted with his fits, <br>
On purpose shut the doors against his way.  <br>
My way is now to hie home to his house, <br>
And tell his wife, that, being lunatic,	 <br>
He rush'd into my house, and took perforce <br>
My ring away. This course I fittest choose, <br>
For forty ducats is too much to lose.<br>
