May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two<br>
Guiltier than him they try. What's open made to justice,<br>
That justice seizes: what know the laws<br>
That thieves do pass on thieves? 'Tis very pregnant,<br>
The jewel that we find, we stoop and take't<br>
Because we see it; but what we do not see<br>
We tread upon, and never think of it.<br>
You may not so extenuate his offence<br>
For I have had such faults; but rather tell me,<br>
When I, that censure him, do so offend,<br>
Let mine own judgment pattern out my death,<br>
And nothing come in partial. Sir, he must die.
