          <b>Sergeant.</b><div align='right'>Doubtful it stood;</div>
      As two spent swimmers, that do cling together<br>
      And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald.<br>
      Worthy to be a rebel, for to that<br>
      The multiplying villanies of nature<br>
      Do swarm upon him.from the western isles<br>
      Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;<br>
      And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,<br>
      Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:<br>
      For brave Macbeth--well he deserves that name. <br>
      Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,<br>
      Which smoked with bloody execution,<br>
      Like valour's minion carved out his passage<br>
      Till he faced the slave;<br>
      Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,<br>
      Till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps,<br>
      And fix'd his head upon our battlements. <br><br>

<del><b>Duncan.</b> O valiant cousin! worthy gentleman! </del><br><br>

<b>Sergeant.</b> As whence the sun 'gins his reflection<br>
      Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break,<br>
      So from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come<br>
      Discomfort swells. Mark, king of Scotland, mark:<br>
      No sooner justice had with valour arm'd<br>
      Compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels,<br>
      But the Norweyan lord surveying vantage,<br>
      With furbish'd arms and new supplies of men<br>
      Began a fresh assault. <br><br>

<del><b>Duncan.</b> Dismay'd not this<br>
      Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo? </del><br><br>

<b>Sergeant.</b> <del>Yes;</del><br>
      As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.<br>
      If I say sooth, I must report they were<br>
      As cannons overcharged with double cracks, so they<br>
      Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:<br>
      Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,<br>
      Or memorise another Golgotha,<br>
      I cannot tell.<br>
      But I am faint, my gashes cry for help.
