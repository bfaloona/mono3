      <div class="monologue_preview">
          Then, I confess,	 <br>
Here on my knee, before high heaven and you  <br>
That before you, and next unto high heaven,   <br>
I love your son.   <br>
My friends were poor, but honest; so's my love:  <br>
Be not offended, for it hurts not him  <br>
That he is lov'd of me: I follow him not  <br>
By any token of presumptuous suit;  <br>
Nor would I have him till I do deserve him; <br> 
Yet never know how that desert should be.  <br>
I know I love in vain, strive against hope;  <br>
Yet, in this captious and intenible sieve  <br>
I still pour in the waters of my love,  <br>
And lack not to lose still. Thus, Indian-like, <br>
Religious in mine error, I adore  <br>
The sun, that looks upon his worshipper, <br> 
But knows of him no more. My dearest madam, <br>
Let not your hate encounter with my love <br>
For loving where you do: but, if yourself, <br> 
Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth, <br> 
Did ever in so true a flame of liking <br> 
Wish chastely and love dearly, that your Dian  <br>
Was both herself and Love; O! then, give pity   <br>
To her, whose state is such that cannot choose   <br>
But lend and give where she is sure to lose;  <br>
That seeks not to find that her search implies, <br>
But, riddle-like, lives sweetly where she dies.
