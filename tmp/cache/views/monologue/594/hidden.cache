          Most sweet voices! <br>
Better it is to die, better to starve,<br>
Than crave the hire which first we do deserve.<br>
Why in this woolvish toge should I stand here,<br>
To beg of Hob and Dick, that do appear,<br>
Their needless vouches? Custom calls me to't: <br>
What custom wills, in all things should we do't,<br>
The dust on antique time would lie unswept,<br>
And mountainous error be too highly heapt<br>
For truth to o'er-peer. Rather than fool it so,<br>
Let the high office and the honour go <br>
To one that would do thus. I am half through;<br>
The one part suffer'd, the other will I do.<br>
[Re-enter three Citizens more]<br>
Here come more voices.<br>
Your voices: for your voices I have fought; <br>
Watch'd for your voices; for Your voices bear<br>
Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six<br>
I have seen and heard of; for your voices have<br>
Done many things, some less, some more your voices:<br>
Indeed I would be consul.
