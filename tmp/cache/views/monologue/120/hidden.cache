          Yes, sir, to Milford-Haven; which is the way? <br>
I thank you. By yond bush? Pray, how far thither? <br>
'Ods pittikins! can it be six mile yet? <br>
I have gone all night: Faith, I'll lie down and sleep.<br> 
[Seeing the body of CLOTEN.]<br> But, soft! no bed-fellow! O gods and goddesses!<br> 
These flowers are like the pleasures of the world; <br>
This bloody man, the care on 't. I hope I dream; <br>
For so I thought I was a cave-keeper, <br>
And cook to honest creatures; but 'tis not so, 
'Twas but a bolt of nothing, shot at nothing, <br>
Which the brain makes of fumes. Our very eyes  <br>
Are sometimes like our judgments, blind. Good faith,<br> 
I tremble still with fear; but if there be <br>
Yet left in heaven as small a drop of pity  <br>
As a wren's eye, fear'd gods, a part of it!  <br>
The dream's here still; even when I wake, it is <br>
Without me, as within me; not imagin'd, felt. <br>
A headless man! The garments of Posthumus! <br>
I know the shape of 's leg, this is his hand, <br>
His foot Mercurial, his Martial thigh, <br>
The brawns of Hercules, but his Jovial face.<br> 
Murder in heaven? How! 'Tis gone. Pisanio, <br>
All curses madded Hecuba gave the Greeks, <br>
And mine to boot, be darted on thee! Thou, <br>
Conspir'd with that irregulous devil, Cloten, <br>
Hast here cut off my lord. To write and read<br>
Be henceforth treacherous! Damn'd Pisanio <br>
Hath with his forged letters, damn'd Pisanio, <br>
From this most bravest vessel of the world <br>
Struck the main-top! O Posthumus! alas! <br>
Where is thy head? where's that? Ay me! where's that?<br> 
Pisanio might have kill'd thee at the heart, <br>
And left this head on. How should this be? Pisanio?<br> 
'Tis he and Cloten; malice and lucre in them <br>
Have laid this woe here. O! 'tis pregnant, pregnant! <br>
The drug he gave me, which he said was precious <br>
And cordial to me, have I not found it  <br>
Murderous to the senses? That confirms it home;<br>
This is Pisanio's deed, and Cloten's: O! <br>
Give colour to my pale cheek with thy blood, <br>
That we the horrider may seem to those <br>
Which chance to find us. O! my lord, my lord.<br>[Falls on the body.]<br>
