          How yet resolves the governor of the town?<br>
This is the latest parle we will admit;<br>
Therefore to our best mercy give yourselves; <br>
Or like to men proud of destruction<br>
Defy us to our worst: for, as I am a soldier,<br>
A name that in my thoughts becomes me best,<br>
If I begin the battery once again,<br>
I will not leave the half-achieved Harfleur <br>
Till in her ashes she lie buried.<br>
The gates of mercy shall be all shut up,<br>
And the flesh'd soldier, rough and hard of heart,<br>
In liberty of bloody hand shall range<br>
With conscience wide as hell, mowing like grass <br>
Your fresh-fair virgins and your flowering infants.<br>
What is it then to me, if impious war,<br>
Array'd in flames like to the prince of fiends,<br>
Do, with his smirch'd complexion, all fell feats<br>
Enlink'd to waste and desolation? <br>
What is't to me, when you yourselves are cause,<br>
If your pure maidens fall into the hand<br>
Of hot and forcing violation?<br>
What rein can hold licentious wickedness<br>
When down the hill he holds his fierce career? <br>
We may as bootless spend our vain command<br>
Upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil<br>
As send precepts to the leviathan<br>
To come ashore. Therefore, you men of Harfleur,<br>
Take pity of your town and of your people, <br>
Whiles yet my soldiers are in my command;<br>
Whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace<br>
O'erblows the filthy and contagious clouds<br>
Of heady murder, spoil and villany.<br>
If not, why, in a moment look to see <br>
The blind and bloody soldier with foul hand<br>
Defile the locks of your shrill-shrieking daughters;<br>
Your fathers taken by the silver beards,<br>
And their most reverend heads dash'd to the walls,<br>
Your naked infants spitted upon pikes, <br>
Whiles the mad mothers with their howls confused<br>
Do break the clouds, as did the wives of Jewry<br>
At Herod's bloody-hunting slaughtermen.<br>
What say you? will you yield, and this avoid,<br>
Or, guilty in defence, be thus destroy'd?
