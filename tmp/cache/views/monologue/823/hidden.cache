              <b>Desdemona.</b><br> Why, then, to-morrow night; or Tuesday morn; <br>
      On Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn:<br>
      I prithee, name the time, but let it not<br>
      Exceed three days: in faith, he's penitent;<br>
      And yet his trespass, in our common reasonâ€”<br>
      Save that, they say, the wars must make examples<br>
      Out of their bestâ€”is not almost a fault<br>
      To incur a private cheque. When shall he come?<br>
      Tell me, Othello: I wonder in my soul,<br>
      What you would ask me, that I should deny,<br>
      Or stand so mammering on. What! Michael Cassio,<br>
      That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,<br>
      When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,<br>
      Hath ta'en your part; to have so much to do<br>
      To bring him in! Trust me, I could do much,â€” <br>
<br>
    <del><b>Othello.</b> Prithee, no more: let him come when he will;<br>
      I will deny thee nothing. </del><br>
<br>
    <b>Desdemona.</b> Why, this is not a boon;<br>
      'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,<br>
      Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,<br>
      Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit <br>
      To your own person: nay, when I have a suit<br>
      Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,<br>
      It shall be full of poise and difficult weight<br>
      And fearful to be granted. <br>
