<b>Porter.</b> Here's a knocking indeed! If a
      man were porter of hell-gate, he should have
      old turning the key.<br>
      <i>[Knocking within]</i><br>
      Knock,
      knock, knock! Who's there, i' the name of
      Beelzebub? Here's a farmer, that hanged
      himself on the expectation of plenty: come in
      time; have napkins enow about you; here
      you'll sweat for't.<br>
      <i>[Knocking within]</i><br>
      Knock,
      knock! Who's there, in the other devil's
      name? Faith, here's an equivocator, that could 
      swear in both the scales against either scale;
      who committed treason enough for God's sake,
      yet could not equivocate to heaven: O, come
      in, equivocator.<br>
      <i>[Knocking within]</i> <br>
      Knock,
      knock, knock! Who's there? Faith, here's an
      English tailor come hither, for stealing out of
      a French hose: come in, tailor; here you may
      roast your goose. <br>
      <i>[Knocking within]</i><br>
      Knock,
      knock; never at quiet! What are you? But
      this place is too cold for hell. I'll devil-porter
      it no further: I had thought to have let in 
      some of all professions that go the primrose
      way to the everlasting bonfire.<br>
      <i>[Knocking within]</i><br>
      Anon, anon! I pray you, remember the porter. <br><br>

<i>[Opens the gate]</i>
