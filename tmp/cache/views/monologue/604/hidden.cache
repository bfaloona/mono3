          <div align="right">This last old man,</div>
Whom with a crack'd heart I have sent to Rome, <br>
Loved me above the measure of a father;<br>
Nay, godded me, indeed. Their latest refuge<br>
Was to send him; for whose old love I have,<br>
Though I show'd sourly to him, once more offer'd<br>
The first conditions, which they did refuse <br>
And cannot now accept; to grace him only<br>
That thought he could do more, a very little<br>
I have yielded to: fresh embassies and suits,<br>
Nor from the state nor private friends, hereafter<br>
Will I lend ear to. Ha! what shout is this? <br>
<i>[Shout within]</i><br>
Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow<br>
In the same time 'tis made? I will not.<br>
<i>[Enter in mourning habits, VIRGILIA, VOLUMNIA,]<br>
leading young CORIOLANUS, VALERIA, and Attendants]</i><br>
My wife comes foremost; then the honour'd mould<br>
Wherein this trunk was framed, and in her hand<br>
The grandchild to her blood. But, out, affection!<br>
All bond and privilege of nature, break!<br>
Let it be virtuous to be obstinate. <br>
What is that curt'sy worth? or those doves' eyes,<br>
Which can make gods forsworn? I melt, and am not<br>
Of stronger earth than others. My mother bows;<br>
As if Olympus to a molehill should<br>
In supplication nod: and my young boy <br>
Hath an aspect of intercession, which<br>
Great nature cries 'Deny not.' let the Volsces<br>
Plough Rome and harrow Italy: I'll never<br>
Be such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand,<br>
As if a man were author of himself <br>
And knew no other kin.
