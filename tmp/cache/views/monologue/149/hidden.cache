          <div align='right'>'Tis more than need.</div>
Have at you, then, affection's men at arms.<br>
Consider what you first did swear unto,<br>
To fast, to study, and to see no woman;<br>
Flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth.<br>
Say, can you fast? your stomachs are too young;<br>
And abstinence engenders maladies. <br>
And where that you have vow'd to study, lords,<br>
In that each of you have forsworn his book,<br>
Can you still dream and pore and thereon look?<br>
For when would you, my lord, or you, or you,<br>
Have found the ground of study's excellence <br>
Without the beauty of a woman's face?<br>
From women's eyes this doctrine I derive;<br>
They are the ground, the books, the academes<br>
From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire<br>
Why, universal plodding poisons up <br>
The nimble spirits in the arteries,<br>
As motion and long-during action tires<br>
The sinewy vigour of the traveller.<br>
Now, for not looking on a woman's face,<br>
You have in that forsworn the use of eyes <br>
And study too, the causer of your vow;<br>
For where is any author in the world<br>
Teaches such beauty as a woman's eye?<br>
Learning is but an adjunct to ourself<br>
And where we are our learning likewise is:<br>
Then when ourselves we see in ladies' eyes,<br>
Do we not likewise see our learning there?<br>
O, we have made a vow to study, lords,<br>
And in that vow we have forsworn our books.<br>
For when would you, my liege, or you, or you,<br>
In leaden contemplation have found out<br>
Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes<br>
Of beauty's tutors have enrich'd you with?<br>
Other slow arts entirely keep the brain;<br>
And therefore, finding barren practisers, <br>
Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil:<br>
But love, first learned in a lady's eyes,<br>
Lives not alone immured in the brain;<br>
But, with the motion of all elements,<br>
Courses as swift as thought in every power,<br>
And gives to every power a double power,<br>
Above their functions and their offices.<br>
It adds a precious seeing to the eye;<br>
A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind;<br>
A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound,<br>
When the suspicious head of theft is stopp'd:<br>
Love's feeling is more soft and sensible<br>
Than are the tender horns of cockl'd snails;<br>
Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:<br>
For valour, is not Love a Hercules, <br>
Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?<br>
Subtle as Sphinx; as sweet and musical<br>
As bright Apollo's lute, strung with his hair:<br>
And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods<br>
Makes heaven drowsy with the harmony. <br>
Never durst poet touch a pen to write<br>
Until his ink were temper'd with Love's sighs;<br>
O, then his lines would ravish savage ears<br>
And plant in tyrants mild humility.<br>
From women's eyes this doctrine I derive: <br>
They sparkle still the right Promethean fire;<br>
They are the books, the arts, the academes,<br>
That show, contain and nourish all the world:<br>
Else none at all in ought proves excellent.<br>
Then fools you were these women to forswear, <br>
Or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.<br>
For wisdom's sake, a word that all men love,<br>
Or for love's sake, a word that loves all men,<br>
Or for men's sake, the authors of these women,<br>
Or women's sake, by whom we men are men, <br>
Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves,<br>
Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths.<br>
It is religion to be thus forsworn,<br>
For charity itself fulfills the law,<br>
And who can sever love from charity?
