          I pray thee, bear my former answer back:<br>
Bid them achieve me and then sell my bones.<br>
Good God! why should they mock poor fellows thus? <br>
The man that once did sell the lion's skin<br>
While the beast lived, was killed with hunting him.<br>
A many of our bodies shall no doubt<br>
Find native graves; upon the which, I trust,<br>
Shall witness live in brass of this day's work: <br>
And those that leave their valiant bones in France,<br>
Dying like men, though buried in your dunghills,<br>
They shall be famed; for there the sun shall greet them,<br>
And draw their honours reeking up to heaven;<br>
Leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime,<br>
The smell whereof shall breed a plague in France.<br>
Mark then abounding valour in our English,<br>
That being dead, like to the bullet's grazing,<br>
Break out into a second course of mischief,<br>
Killing in relapse of mortality. <br>
Let me speak proudly: tell the constable<br>
We are but warriors for the working-day;<br>
Our gayness and our gilt are all besmirch'd<br>
With rainy marching in the painful field;<br>
There's not a piece of feather in our host— <br>
Good argument, I hope, we will not fly—<br>
And time hath worn us into slovenry:<br>
But, by the mass, our hearts are in the trim;<br>
And my poor soldiers tell me, yet ere night<br>
They'll be in fresher robes, or they will pluck <br>
The gay new coats o'er the French soldiers' heads<br>
And turn them out of service. If they do this,—<br>
As, if God please, they shall,—my ransom then<br>
Will soon be levied. Herald, save thou thy labour;<br>
Come thou no more for ransom, gentle herald: <br>
They shall have none, I swear, but these my joints;<br>
Which if they have as I will leave 'em them,<br>
Shall yield them little, tell the constable.
