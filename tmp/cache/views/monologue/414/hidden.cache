          For this I shall have time enough to mourn.<br>
In poison there is physic; and these news, <br>
Having been well, that would have made me sick,<br>
Being sick, have in some measure made me well;<br>
And as the wretch whose fever-weak'ned joints,<br>
Like strengthless hinges, buckle under life,<br>
Impatient of his fit, breaks like a fire <br>
Out of his keeper's arms, even so my limbs,<br>
Weak'ned with grief, being now enrag'd with grief,<br>
Are thrice themselves. Hence, therefore, thou nice crutch!<br>
A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel<br>
Must glove this hand; and hence, thou sickly coif! <br>
Thou art a guard too wanton for the head<br>
Which princes, flesh'd with conquest, aim to hit.<br>
Now bind my brows with iron; and approach<br>
The ragged'st hour that time and spite dare bring<br>
To frown upon th' enrag'd Northumberland! <br>
Let heaven kiss earth! Now let not Nature's hand<br>
Keep the wild flood confin'd! Let order die!<br>
And let this world no longer be a stage<br>
To feed contention in a ling'ring act;<br>
But let one spirit of the first-born Cain <br>
Reign in all bosoms, that, each heart being set<br>
On bloody courses, the rude scene may end<br>
And darkness be the burier of the dead!
