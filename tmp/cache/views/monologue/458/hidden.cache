          What's he that wishes so?<br>
My cousin Westmoreland? No, my fair cousin:<br>
If we are mark'd to die, we are enow <br>
To do our country loss; and if to live,<br>
The fewer men, the greater share of honour.<br>
God's will! I pray thee, wish not one man more.<br>
By Jove, I am not covetous for gold,<br>
Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost; <br>
It yearns me not if men my garments wear;<br>
Such outward things dwell not in my desires:<br>
But if it be a sin to covet honour,<br>
I am the most offending soul alive.<br>
No, faith, my coz, wish not a man from England: <br>
God's peace! I would not lose so great an honour<br>
As one man more, methinks, would share from me<br>
For the best hope I have. O, do not wish one more!<br>
Rather proclaim it, Westmoreland, through my host,<br>
That he which hath no stomach to this fight, <br>
Let him depart; his passport shall be made<br>
And crowns for convoy put into his purse:<br>
We would not die in that man's company<br>
That fears his fellowship to die with us.<br>
This day is called the feast of Crispian: <br>
He that outlives this day, and comes safe home,<br>
Will stand a tip-toe when the day is named,<br>
And rouse him at the name of Crispian.<br>
He that shall live this day, and see old age,<br>
Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours, <br>
And say 'To-morrow is Saint Crispian:'<br>
Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars.<br>
And say 'These wounds I had on Crispin's day.'<br>
Old men forget: yet all shall be forgot,<br>
But he'll remember with advantages <br>
What feats he did that day: then shall our names.<br>
Familiar in his mouth as household words<br>
Harry the king, Bedford and Exeter,<br>
Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester,<br>
Be in their flowing cups freshly remember'd. <br>
This story shall the good man teach his son;<br>
And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by,<br>
From this day to the ending of the world,<br>
But we in it shall be remember'd;<br>
We few, we happy few, we band of brothers; <br>
For he to-day that sheds his blood with me<br>
Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,<br>
This day shall gentle his condition:<br>
And gentlemen in England now a-bed<br>
Shall think themselves accursed they were not here, <br>
And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks<br>
That fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day.
