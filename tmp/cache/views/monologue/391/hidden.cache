          This she? no, this is Diomed's Cressida:<br>
If beauty have a soul, this is not she;<br>
If souls guide vows, if vows be sanctimonies,<br>
If sanctimony be the gods' delight,<br>
If there be rule in unity itself, <br>
This is not she. O madness of discourse,<br>
That cause sets up with and against itself!<br>
Bi-fold authority! where reason can revolt<br>
Without perdition, and loss assume all reason<br>
Without revolt: this is, and is not, Cressid. <br>
Within my soul there doth conduce a fight<br>
Of this strange nature that a thing inseparate<br>
Divides more wider than the sky and earth,<br>
And yet the spacious breadth of this division<br>
Admits no orifex for a point as subtle <br>
As Ariachne's broken woof to enter.<br>
Instance, O instance! strong as Pluto's gates;<br>
Cressid is mine, tied with the bonds of heaven:<br>
Instance, O instance! strong as heaven itself;<br>
The bonds of heaven are slipp'd, dissolved, and loosed; <br>
And with another knot, five-finger-tied,<br>
The fractions of her faith, orts of her love,<br>
The fragments, scraps, the bits and greasy relics<br>
Of her o'er-eaten faith, are bound to Diomed.
