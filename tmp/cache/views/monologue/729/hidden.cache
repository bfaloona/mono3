          There is an old tale goes that Herne the hunter,<br>
Sometime a keeper here in Windsor forest,<br>
Doth all the winter-time, at still midnight,<br>
Walk round about an oak, with great ragg'd horns;<br>
And there he blasts the tree and takes the cattle<br>
And makes milch-kine yield blood and shakes a chain<br>
In a most hideous and dreadful manner:<br>
You have heard of such a spirit, and well you know<br>
The superstitious idle-headed eld<br>
Received and did deliver to our age<br>
This tale of Herne the hunter for a truth.
