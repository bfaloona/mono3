      <div class="monologue_preview">
          Weeps she still, sayst thou? Dost thou think in time	 <br>
She will not quench, and let instructions enter	 <br>
Where folly now possesses? Do thou work:<br> 
When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son,<br>
I'll tell thee on the instant thou art then <br>
As great as is thy master; greater, for <br>
His fortunes all lie speechless, and his name <br>
Is at last gasp; return he cannot, nor <br>
Continue where he is; to shift his being <br>
Is to exchange one misery with another, <br>
And every day that comes comes to decay	 <br>
A day's work in him. What shalt thou expect, <br>
To be depender on a thing that leans, <br>
Who cannot be new built, nor has no friends,<br> 
So much as but to prop him? <br> 
[The QUEEN drops the box; PISANIO takes it up.]<br> 
Thou tak'st up
Thou know'st not what; but take it for thy labour:<br> 
It is a thing I made, which hath the king <br>
Five times redeem'd from death; I do not know <br>
What is more cordial: nay, I prithee, take it; <br>
It is an earnest of a further good <br>
That I mean to thee. Tell thy mistress how <br>
The case stands with her; do 't as from thyself. <br>
Think what a chance thou changest on, but think <br>
Thou hast thy mistress still, to boot, my son, <br>
Who shall take notice of thee. I'll move the king <br>
To any shape of thy preferment such  <br>
As thou'lt desire; and then myself, I chiefly,<br>
That set thee on to this desert, am bound <br>
To load thy merit richly. Call my women; <br>
Think on my words.  [Exit PISANIO.]<br> 
A sly and constant knave,   <br>
Not to be shak'd; the agent for his master,<br> 
And the remembrancer of her to hold  <br>
The hand-fast to her lord. I have given him that <br>
Which, if he take, shall quite unpeople her <br>
Of leigers for her sweet, and which she after, <br>
Except she bend her humour, shall be assur'd <br>
To taste of too' <br>
[Re-Enter PISANIO and Ladies']<br>
So, so;'well done, well done. <br>
The violets, cowslips, and the prime-roses<br> 
Bear to my closet. Fare thee well, Pisanio: <br>
Think on my words. <br>
