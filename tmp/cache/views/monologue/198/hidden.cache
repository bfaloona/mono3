          No, not a whit; I find you passing gentle.<br>
'Twas told me you were rough, and coy, and sullen,<br>
And now I find report a very liar;<br>
For thou art pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,<br>
But slow in speech, yet sweet as springtime flowers.<br>
Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance,<br>
Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will,<br>
Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk;<br>
But thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers;<br>
With gentle conference, soft and affable.<br>
Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?<br>
O sland'rous world! Kate like the hazel-twig<br>
Is straight and slender, and as brown in hue<br>
As hazel-nuts, and sweeter than the kernels. <br>
O, let me see thee walk. Thou dost not halt.
