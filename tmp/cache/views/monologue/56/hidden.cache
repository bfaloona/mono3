          Welcome, good Robin. See'st thou this sweet sight?<br>
Her dotage now I do begin to pity: <br>
For, meeting her of late behind the wood,<br>
Seeking sweet favours from this hateful fool,<br>
I did upbraid her and fall out with her;<br>
For she his hairy temples then had rounded<br>
With a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers; <br>
And that same dew, which sometime on the buds<br>
Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls,<br>
Stood now within the pretty flowerets' eyes<br>
Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.<br>
When I had at my pleasure taunted her<br>
And she in mild terms begg'd my patience,<br>
I then did ask of her her changeling child;<br>
Which straight she gave me, and her fairy sent<br>
To bear him to my bower in fairy land.<br>
And now I have the boy, I will undo<br>
This hateful imperfection of her eyes:<br>
And, gentle Puck, take this transformed scalp<br>
From off the head of this Athenian swain;<br>
That, he awaking when the other do,<br>
May all to Athens back again repair <br>
And think no more of this night's accidents<br>
But as the fierce vexation of a dream.<br>
But first I will release the fairy queen.<br>
Be as thou wast wont to be;<br>
See as thou wast wont to see: <br>
Dian's bud o'er Cupid's flower<br>
Hath such force and blessed power.<br>
Now, my Titania; wake you, my sweet queen.
