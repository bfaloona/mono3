          Stay, Roman brethren! Gracious conqueror,<br>
Victorious Titus, rue the tears I shed,<br>
A mother's tears in passion for her son:<br>
And if thy sons were ever dear to thee,<br>
O, think my son to be as dear to me! <br>
Sufficeth not that we are brought to Rome,<br>
To beautify thy triumphs and return,<br>
Captive to thee and to thy Roman yoke,<br>
But must my sons be slaughter'd in the streets,<br>
For valiant doings in their country's cause?<br>
O, if to fight for king and commonweal<br>
Were piety in thine, it is in these.<br>
Andronicus, stain not thy tomb with blood:<br>
Wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods?<br>
Draw near them then in being merciful: <br>
Sweet mercy is nobility's true badge:<br>
Thrice noble Titus, spare my first-born son.
