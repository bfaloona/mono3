          Oft have I heard of you, my Lord Biron,<br>
Before I saw you; and the world's large tongue <br>
Proclaims you for a man replete with mocks,<br>
Full of comparisons and wounding flouts,<br>
Which you on all estates will execute<br>
That lie within the mercy of your wit.<br>
To weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain,<br>
And therewithal to win me, if you please,<br>
Without the which I am not to be won,<br>
You shall this twelvemonth term from day to day<br>
Visit the speechless sick and still converse<br>
With groaning wretches; and your task shall be, <br>
With all the fierce endeavor of your wit<br>
To enforce the pained impotent to smile.
