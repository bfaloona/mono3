The fairy land buys not the child of me.<br>
His mother was a votaress of my order:<br>
And, in the spiced Indian air, by night,<br>
Full often hath she gossip'd by my side, <br>
And sat with me on Neptune's yellow sands,<br>
Marking the embarked traders on the flood,<br>
When we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive<br>
And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;<br>
Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait <br>
Following,.her womb then rich with my young squire,--<br>
Would imitate, and sail upon the land,<br>
To fetch me trifles, and return again,<br>
As from a voyage, rich with merchandise.<br>
But she, being mortal, of that boy did die; <br>
And for her sake do I rear up her boy,<br>
And for her sake I will not part with him.
