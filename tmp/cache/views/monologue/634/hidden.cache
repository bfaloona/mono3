      <div class="monologue_preview">
          I heard myself proclaim'd,<br>
And by the happy hollow of a tree<br>
Escap'd the hunt. No port is free, no place<br>
That guard and most unusual vigilance <br>
Does not attend my taking. Whiles I may scape,<br>
I will preserve myself; and am bethought<br>
To take the basest and most poorest shape<br>
That ever penury, in contempt of man,<br>
Brought near to beast. My face I'll grime with filth, <br>
Blanket my loins, elf all my hair in knots,<br>
And with presented nakedness outface<br>
The winds and persecutions of the sky.<br>
The country gives me proof and precedent<br>
Of Bedlam beggars, who, with roaring voices, <br>
Strike in their numb'd and mortified bare arms<br>
Pins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary;<br>
And with this horrible object, from low farms,<br>
Poor pelting villages, sheepcotes, and mills,<br>
Sometime with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers, <br>
Enforce their charity. 'Poor Turlygod! poor Tom!'<br>
That's something yet! Edgar I nothing am.<br>
