          <b>Duke of Exeter.</b> From him; and thus he greets your majesty.<br>
 He wills you, in the name of God Almighty,<br>
 That you divest yourself, and lay apart<br>
 The borrow'd glories that by gift of heaven,<br>
 By law of nature and of nations, 'long<br>
 To him and to his heirs; namely, the crown<br>
 And all wide-stretched honours that pertain<br>
 By custom and the ordinance of times<br>
 Unto the crown of France. That you may know<br>
 'Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim,<br>
 Pick'd from the worm-holes of long-vanish'd days,<br>
 Nor from the dust of old oblivion raked, <br>
 He sends you this most memorable line,<br>
 In every branch truly demonstrative;<br>
 Willing to overlook this pedigree:<br>
 And when you find him evenly derived<br>
 From his most famed of famous ancestors, <br>
 Edward the Third, he bids you then resign<br>
 Your crown and kingdom, indirectly held<br>
 From him the native and true challenger. <br>
<br>
<del><b>King of France.</b> Or else what follows?</del> <br>
<br>
<b>Duke of Exeter.</b> Bloody constraint; for if you hide the crown <br>
 Even in your hearts, there will he rake for it:<br>
 Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming,<br>
 In thunder and in earthquake, like a Jove,<br>
 That, if requiring fail, he will compel;<br>
 And bids you, in the bowels of the Lord, <br>
 Deliver up the crown, and to take mercy<br>
 On the poor souls for whom this hungry war<br>
 Opens his vasty jaws; and on your head<br>
 Turning the widows' tears, the orphans' cries<br>
 The dead men's blood, the pining maidens groans, <br>
 For husbands, fathers and betrothed lovers,<br>
 That shall be swallow'd in this controversy.<br>
 This is his claim, his threatening and my message;<br>
 Unless the Dauphin be in presence here,<br>
 To whom expressly I bring greeting too. <br>
<br>
<del><b>King of France.</b> For us, we will consider of this further:<br>
 To-morrow shall you bear our full intent<br>
 Back to our brother England. <br>
<br>
<b>Lewis the Dauphin.</b> For the Dauphin,<br>
 I stand here for him: what to him from England?</del> <br>
<br>
<b>Duke of Exeter.</b> Scorn and defiance; slight regard, contempt,<br>
 And any thing that may not misbecome<br>
 The mighty sender, doth he prize you at.<br>
 Thus says my king; an' if your father's highness<br>
 Do not, in grant of all demands at large, <br>
 Sweeten the bitter mock you sent his majesty,<br>
 He'll call you to so hot an answer of it,<br>
 That caves and womby vaultages of France<br>
 Shall chide your trespass and return your mock<br>
 In second accent of his ordnance. <br>
<br>
<del><b>Lewis the Dauphin.</b> Say, if my father render fair return,<br>
 It is against my will; for I desire<br>
 Nothing but odds with England: to that end,<br>
 As matching to his youth and vanity,<br>
 I did present him with the Paris balls.</del> <br>
<br>
<b>Duke of Exeter.</b> He'll make your Paris Louvre shake for it,<br>
 Were it the mistress-court of mighty Europe:<br>
 And, be assured, you'll find a difference,<br>
 As we his subjects have in wonder found,<br>
 Between the promise of his greener days <br>
 And these he masters now: now he weighs time<br>
 Even to the utmost grain: that you shall read<br>
 In your own losses, if he stay in France.
