          God quit you in his mercy! Hear your sentence.<br>
You have conspired against our royal person,<br>
Join'd with an enemy proclaim'd and from his coffers<br>
Received the golden earnest of our death; <br>
Wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter,<br>
His princes and his peers to servitude,<br>
His subjects to oppression and contempt<br>
And his whole kingdom into desolation.<br>
Touching our person seek we no revenge; <br>
But we our kingdom's safety must so tender,<br>
Whose ruin you have sought, that to her laws<br>
We do deliver you. Get you therefore hence,<br>
Poor miserable wretches, to your death:<br>
The taste whereof, God of his mercy give<br>
You patience to endure, and true repentance<br>
Of all your dear offences! Bear them hence.<br>
<i>[Exeunt CAMBRIDGE, SCROOP and GREY, guarded]</i><br>
Now, lords, for France; the enterprise whereof<br>
Shall be to you, as us, like glorious. <br>
We doubt not of a fair and lucky war,<br>
Since God so graciously hath brought to light<br>
This dangerous treason lurking in our way<br>
To hinder our beginnings. We doubt not now<br>
But every rub is smoothed on our way. <br>
Then forth, dear countrymen: let us deliver<br>
Our puissance into the hand of God,<br>
Putting it straight in expedition.<br>
Cheerly to sea; the signs of war advance:<br>
No king of England, if not king of France.
