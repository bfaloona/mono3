          If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.<br>
You all do know this mantle: I remember <br>
The first time ever Caesar put it on;<br>
'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,<br>
That day he overcame the Nervii:<br>
Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through:<br>
See what a rent the envious Casca made: <br>
Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;<br>
And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,<br>
Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it,<br>
As rushing out of doors, to be resolved<br>
If Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no; <br>
For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel:<br>
Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!<br>
This was the most unkindest cut of all;<br>
For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,<br>
Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms, <br>
Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his mighty heart;<br>
And, in his mantle muffling up his face,<br>
Even at the base of Pompey's statua,<br>
Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.<br>
O, what a fall was there, my countrymen! <br>
Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,<br>
Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.<br>
O, now you weep; and, I perceive, you feel<br>
The dint of pity: these are gracious drops.<br>
Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold <br>
Our Caesar's vesture wounded? Look you here,<br>
Here is himself, marr'd, as you see, with traitors.
