          You sad-faced men, people and sons of Rome, <br>
By uproar sever'd, like a flight of fowl<br>
Scatter'd by winds and high tempestuous gusts,<br>
O, let me teach you how to knit again<br>
This scatter'd corn into one mutual sheaf,<br>
These broken limbs again into one body; <br>
Lest Rome herself be bane unto herself,<br>
And she whom mighty kingdoms court'sy to,<br>
Like a forlorn and desperate castaway,<br>
Do shameful execution on herself.<br>
But if my frosty signs and chaps of age,<br>
Grave witnesses of true experience,<br>
Cannot induce you to attend my words,<br>
<i>[To LUCIUS]</i><br>
Speak, Rome's dear friend, as erst our ancestor,<br>
When with his solemn tongue he did discourse <br>
To love-sick Dido's sad attending ear<br>
The story of that baleful burning night<br>
When subtle Greeks surprised King Priam's Troy,<br>
Tell us what Sinon hath bewitch'd our ears,<br>
Or who hath brought the fatal engine in <br>
That gives our Troy, our Rome, the civil wound.<br>
My heart is not compact of flint nor steel;<br>
Nor can I utter all our bitter grief,<br>
But floods of tears will drown my oratory,<br>
And break my utterance, even in the time<br>
When it should move you to attend me most,<br>
Lending your kind commiseration.<br>
Here is a captain, let him tell the tale;<br>
Your hearts will throb and weep to hear him speak.
