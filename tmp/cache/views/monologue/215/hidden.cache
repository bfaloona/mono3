          O, my good lord, why are you thus alone?<br>
For what offence have I this fortnight been<br>
A banish'd woman from my Harry's bed?<br>
Tell me, sweet lord, what is't that takes from thee<br>
Thy stomach, pleasure and thy golden sleep? <br>
Why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth,<br>
And start so often when thou sit'st alone?<br>
Why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks;<br>
And given my treasures and my rights of thee<br>
To thick-eyed musing and cursed melancholy? <br>
In thy faint slumbers I by thee have watch'd,<br>
And heard thee murmur tales of iron wars;<br>
Speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed;<br>
Cry 'Courage! to the field!' And thou hast talk'd<br>
Of sallies and retires, of trenches, tents, <br>
Of palisadoes, frontiers, parapets,<br>
Of basilisks, of cannon, culverin,<br>
Of prisoners' ransom and of soldiers slain,<br>
And all the currents of a heady fight.<br>
Thy spirit within thee hath been so at war <br>
And thus hath so bestirr'd thee in thy sleep,<br>
That beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow<br>
Like bubbles in a late-disturbed stream;<br>
And in thy face strange motions have appear'd,<br>
Such as we see when men restrain their breath <br>
On some great sudden hest. O, what portents are these?<br>
Some heavy business hath my lord in hand,<br>
And I must know it, else he loves me not.
