          Then, noble auditory, be it known to you, <br>
That cursed Chiron and Demetrius<br>
Were they that murdered our emperor's brother;<br>
And they it were that ravished our sister:<br>
For their fell faults our brothers were beheaded;<br>
Our father's tears despised, and basely cozen'd <br>
Of that true hand that fought Rome's quarrel out,<br>
And sent her enemies unto the grave.<br>
Lastly, myself unkindly banished,<br>
The gates shut on me, and turn'd weeping out,<br>
To beg relief among Rome's enemies: <br>
Who drown'd their enmity in my true tears.<br>
And oped their arms to embrace me as a friend.<br>
I am the turned forth, be it known to you,<br>
That have preserved her welfare in my blood;<br>
And from her bosom took the enemy's point, <br>
Sheathing the steel in my adventurous body.<br>
Alas, you know I am no vaunter, I;<br>
My scars can witness, dumb although they are,<br>
That my report is just and full of truth.<br>
But, soft! methinks I do digress too much, <br>
Citing my worthless praise: O, pardon me;<br>
For when no friends are by, men praise themselves.
