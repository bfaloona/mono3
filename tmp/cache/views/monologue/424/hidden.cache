          Wherefore do I this? So the question stands.<br>
Briefly to this end: we are all diseas'd<br>
And with our surfeiting and wanton hours<br>
Have brought ourselves into a burning fever,<br>
And we must bleed for it; of which disease<br>
Our late King, Richard, being infected, died.<br>
But, my most noble Lord of Westmoreland,<br>
I take not on me here as a physician;<br>
Nor do I as an enemy to peace<br>
Troop in the throngs of military men;<br>
But rather show awhile like fearful war<br>
To diet rank minds sick of happiness,<br>
And purge th' obstructions which begin to stop<br>
Our very veins of life. Hear me more plainly.<br>
I have in equal balance justly weigh'd<br>
What wrongs our arms may do, what wrongs we suffer,<br>
And find our griefs heavier than our offences.<br>
We see which way the stream of time doth run<br>
And are enforc'd from our most quiet there<br>
By the rough torrent of occasion;<br>
And have the summary of all our griefs,<br>
When time shall serve, to show in articles;<br>
Which long ere this we offer'd to the King,<br>
And might by no suit gain our audience:<br>
When we are wrong'd, and would unfold our griefs,<br>
We are denied access unto his person,<br>
Even by those men that most have done us wrong.<br>
The dangers of the days but newly gone,<br>
Whose memory is written on the earth<br>
With yet appearing blood, and the examples<br>
Of every minute's instance, present now,<br>
Hath put us in these ill-beseeming arms;<br>
Not to break peace, or any branch of it,<br>
But to establish here a peace indeed,<br>
Concurring both in name and quality.
