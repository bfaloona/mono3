          [Adam]	What! my young master? O my gentle master!<br>
O my sweet master! O you memory <br>
Of old Sir Rowland! why, what make you here?<br> 
Why are you virtuous? Why do people love you? <br>
And wherefore are you gentle, strong, and valiant? <br>
Why would you be so fond to overcome <br>
The bony priser of the humorous duke? <br>
Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.<br> 
Know you not, master, to some kind of men <br>
Their graces serve them but as enemies? <br>
No more do yours: your virtues, gentle master,<br> 
Are sanctified and holy traitors to you. <br>
O, what a world is this, when what is comely <br>
Envenoms him that bears it! <br>
<font size='-1' style='text-decoration: line-through;'>
[Orl.]  Why, what's the matter? <br></font>
[Adam]        O unhappy youth!	<br> 
Come not within these doors; within this roof <br>
The enemy of all your graces lives.  <br>
Your brother,'no, no brother; yet the son,.<br> 
Yet not the son, I will not call him son <br>
Of him I was about to call his father,.<br>
Hath heard your praises, and this night he means<br> 
To burn the lodging where you use to lie, <br>
And you within it: if he fail of that, <br>
He will have other means to cut you off. <br>
I overheard him and his practices. <br>
This is no place; this house is but a butchery:<br> 
Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.
