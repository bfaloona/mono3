          How courtesy would seem to cover sin,<br>
When what is done is like an hypocrite,<br>
The which is good in nothing but in sight!<br>
If it be true that I interpret false,<br>
Then were it certain you were not so bad<br>
As with foul incest to abuse your soul;<br>
Where now you're both a father and a son,<br>
By your untimely claspings with your child, <br>
Which pleasure fits an husband, not a father;<br>
And she an eater of her mother's flesh,<br>
By the defiling of her parent's bed;<br>
And both like serpents are, who though they feed<br>
On sweetest flowers, yet they poison breed. <br>
Antioch, farewell! for wisdom sees, those men<br>
Blush not in actions blacker than the night,<br>
Will shun no course to keep them from the light.<br>
One sin, I know, another doth provoke;<br>
Murder's as near to lust as flame to smoke: <br>
Poison and treason are the hands of sin,<br>
Ay, and the targets, to put off the shame:<br>
Then, lest my lie be cropp'd to keep you clear,<br>
By flight I'll shun the danger which I fear.
