      <div class="monologue_preview">
          Hear him but reason in divinity ,<br>
And all-admiring with an inward wish<br>
You would desire the king were made a prelate:<br>
Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs, <br>
You would say it hath been all in all his study:<br>
List his discourse of war, and you shall hear<br>
A fearful battle render'd you in music:<br>
Turn him to any cause of policy,<br>
The Gordian knot of it he will unloose, <br>
Familiar as his garter: that, when he speaks,<br>
The air, a charter'd libertine, is still,<br>
And the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears,<br>
To steal his sweet and honey'd sentences;<br>
So that the art and practic part of life<br>
Must be the mistress to this theoric:<br>
Which is a wonder how his grace should glean it,<br>
Since his addiction was to courses vain,<br>
His companies unletter'd, rude and shallow,<br>
His hours fill'd up with riots, banquets, sports,<br>
And never noted in him any study,<br>
Any retirement, any sequestration<br>
From open haunts and popularity.
