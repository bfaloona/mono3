          And she shall thank you for't, if e'er you know her. <br>
A virtuous gentlewoman, mild and beautiful<br>
I hope my master's suit will be but cold,<br>
Since she respects my mistress' love so much.<br>
Alas, how love can trifle with itself!<br>
Here is her picture: let me see; I think, <br>
If I had such a tire, this face of mine<br>
Were full as lovely as is this of hers:<br>
And yet the painter flatter'd her a little,<br>
Unless I flatter with myself too much.<br>
Her hair is auburn, mine is perfect yellow:<br>
If that be all the difference in his love,<br>
I'll get me such a colour'd periwig.<br>
Her eyes are grey as glass, and so are mine:<br>
Ay, but her forehead's low, and mine's as high.<br>
What should it be that he respects in her <br>
But I can make respective in myself,<br>
If this fond Love were not a blinded god?<br>
Come, shadow, come and take this shadow up,<br>
For 'tis thy rival. O thou senseless form,<br>
Thou shalt be worshipp'd, kiss'd, loved and adored! <br>
And, were there sense in his idolatry,<br>
My substance should be statue in thy stead.<br>
I'll use thee kindly for thy mistress' sake,<br>
That used me so; or else, by Jove I vow,<br>
I should have scratch'd out your unseeing eyes <br>
To make my master out of love with thee!
