      <div class="monologue_preview">
          Look here upon th's picture, and on this, <br>
The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.<br>
See what a grace was seated on this brow;<br>
Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;<br>
An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;<br>
A station like the herald Mercury <br>
New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:<br>
A combination and a form indeed<br>
Where every god did seem to set his seal<br>
To give the world assurance of a man.<br>
This was your husband. Look you now what follows.<br>
Here is your husband, like a mildew'd ear<br>
Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?<br>
Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,<br>
And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes<br>
You cannot call it love; for at your age<br>
The heyday in the blood is tame, it's humble,<br>
And waits upon the judgment; and what judgment<br>
Would step from this to this? Sense sure you have,<br>
Else could you not have motion; but sure that sense<br>
Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err, <br>
Nor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thrall'd<br>
But it reserv'd some quantity of choice<br>
To serve in such a difference. What devil was't<br>
That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?<br>
Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight, <br>
Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,<br>
Or but a sickly part of one true sense<br>
Could not so mope.<br>
O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,<br>
If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones, <br>
To flaming youth let virtue be as wax<br>
And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame<br>
When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,<br>
Since frost itself as actively doth burn,<br>
And reason panders will. <br>
