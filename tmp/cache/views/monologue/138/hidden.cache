          Let fame, that all hunt after in their lives,<br>
Live register'd upon our brazen tombs<br>
And then grace us in the disgrace of death;<br>
When, spite of cormorant devouring Time,<br>
The endeavor of this present breath may buy<br>
That honour which shall bate his scythe's keen edge<br>
And make us heirs of all eternity.<br>
Therefore, brave conquerors,.for so you are,<br>
That war against your own affections<br>
And the huge army of the world's desires,.<br>
Our late edict shall strongly stand in force:<br>
Navarre shall be the wonder of the world;<br>
Our court shall be a little Academe,<br>
Still and contemplative in living art.<br>
You three, Biron, Dumain, and Longaville,<br>
Have sworn for three years' term to live with me<br>
My fellow-scholars, and to keep those statutes<br>
That are recorded in this schedule here:<br>
Your oaths are pass'd; and now subscribe your names,<br>
That his own hand may strike his honour down<br>
That violates the smallest branch herein:<br>
If you are arm'd to do as sworn to do,<br>
Subscribe to your deep oaths, and keep it too.<br>
