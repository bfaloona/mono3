          <b>Coriolanus.</b> I'll give my reasons,<br>
 More worthier than their voices. They know the corn<br>
 Was not our recompense, resting well assured <br>
 That ne'er did service for't: being press'd to the war,<br>
 Even when the navel of the state was touch'd,<br>
 They would not thread the gates. This kind of service<br>
 Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i' the war<br>
 Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd <br>
 Most valour, spoke not for them: the accusation<br>
 Which they have often made against the senate,<br>
 All cause unborn, could never be the motive<br>
 Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?<br>
 How shall this bisson multitude digest <br>
 The senate's courtesy? Let deeds express<br>
 What's like to be their words: 'we did request it;<br>
 We are the greater poll, and in true fear<br>
 They gave us our demands.' Thus we debase<br>
 The nature of our seats and make the rabble <br>
 Call our cares fears; which will in time<br>
 Break ope the locks o' the senate and bring in<br>
 The crows to peck the eagles. <br>
<br>
<del><b>Menenius Agrippa.</b> Come, enough. <br>
<br>
<b>Junius Brutus.</b> Enough, with over-measure.</del> <br>
<br>
<b>Coriolanus.</b> No, take more:<br>
 What may be sworn by, both divine and human,<br>
 Seal what I end withal! This double worship,<br>
 Where one part does disdain with cause, the other<br>
 Insult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom, <br>
 Cannot conclude but by the yea and no<br>
 Of general ignorance,â€”it must omit<br>
 Real necessities, and give way the while<br>
 To unstable slightness: purpose so barr'd, it follows, <br>
 Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you,â€”<br>
 You that will be less fearful than discreet,<br>
 That love the fundamental part of state<br>
 More than you doubt the change on't, that prefer<br>
 A noble life before a long, and wish <br>
 To jump a body with a dangerous physic<br>
 That's sure of death without it, at once pluck out<br>
 The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick<br>
 The sweet which is their poison: your dishonour<br>
 Mangles true judgment and bereaves the state<br>
 Of that integrity which should become't,<br>
 Not having the power to do the good it would,<br>
 For the in which doth control't. <br>
<br>
<del><b>Junius Brutus.</b> Has said enough. <br>
<br>
<b>Sicinius Velutus.</b> Has spoken like a traitor, and shall answer <br>
 As traitors do. </del><br>
<br>
<b>Coriolanus.</b> Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee!<br>
 What should the people do with these bald tribunes?<br>
 On whom depending, their obedience fails<br>
 To the greater bench: in a rebellion, <br>
 When what's not meet, but what must be, was law,<br>
 Then were they chosen: in a better hour,<br>
 Let what is meet be said it must be meet,<br>
 And throw their power i' the dust.
