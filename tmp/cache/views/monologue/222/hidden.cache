          I am accursed to rob in that thief's company: the<br>
rascal hath removed my horse, and tied him I know<br>
not where. If I travel but four foot by the squier<br>
further afoot, I shall break my wind. Well, I doubt<br>
not but to die a fair death for all this, if I<br>
'scape hanging for killing that rogue. I have <br>
forsworn his company hourly any time this two and<br>
twenty years, and yet I am bewitched with the<br>
rogue's company. If the rascal hath not given me<br>
medicines to make me love him, I'll be hanged; it<br>
could not be else: I have drunk medicines. Poins! <br>
Hal! a plague upon you both! Bardolph! Peto!<br>
I'll starve ere I'll rob a foot further. An 'twere<br>
not as good a deed as drink, to turn true man and to<br>
leave these rogues, I am the veriest varlet that<br>
ever chewed with a tooth. Eight yards of uneven <br>
ground is threescore and ten miles afoot with me;<br>
and the stony-hearted villains know it well enough:<br>
a plague upon it when thieves cannot be true one to another!<br>
[They whistle]<br>
Whew! A plague upon you all! Give me my horse, you<br>
rogues; give me my horse, and be hanged!
