          First, as you know, my house within the city<br>
Is richly furnished with plate and gold,<br>
Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands;<br>
My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry;<br>
In ivory coffers I have stuff'd my crowns;<br>
In cypress chests my arras counterpoints,<br>
Costly apparel, tents, and canopies, <br>
Fine linen, Turkey cushions boss'd with pearl,<br>
Valance of Venice gold in needle-work;<br>
Pewter and brass, and all things that belongs<br>
To house or housekeeping. Then at my farm<br>
I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail, <br>
Six score fat oxen standing in my stalls,<br>
And all things answerable to this portion.<br>
Myself am struck in years, I must confess;<br>
And if I die to-morrow this is hers,<br>
If whilst I live she will be only mine.
