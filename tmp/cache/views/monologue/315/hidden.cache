      <div class="monologue_preview">
           From time to time I have acquainted you<br>
With the dear love I bear to fair Anne Page;<br>
Who mutually hath answer'd my affection,<br>
So far forth as herself might be her chooser,<br>
Even to my wish: I have a letter from her<br>
Of such contents as you will wonder at; <br>
The mirth whereof so larded with my matter,<br>
That neither singly can be manifested,<br>
Without the show of both; fat Falstaff<br>
Hath a great scene: the image of the jest<br>
I'll show you here at large. Hark, good mine host. <br>
To-night at Herne's oak, just 'twixt twelve and one,<br>
Must my sweet Nan present the Fairy Queen;<br>
The purpose why, is here: in which disguise,<br>
While other jests are something rank on foot,<br>
Her father hath commanded her to slip <br>
Away with Slender and with him at Eton<br>
Immediately to marry: she hath consented: Now, sir,<br>
Her mother, ever strong against that match<br>
And firm for Doctor Caius, hath appointed<br>
That he shall likewise shuffle her away, <br>
While other sports are tasking of their minds,<br>
And at the deanery, where a priest attends,<br>
Straight marry her: to this her mother's plot<br>
She seemingly obedient likewise hath<br>
Made promise to the doctor. Now, thus it rests:<br>
Her father means she shall be all in white,<br>
And in that habit, when Slender sees his time<br>
To take her by the hand and bid her go,<br>
She shall go with him: her mother hath intended,<br>
The better to denote her to the doctor, <br>
For they must all be mask'd and vizarded,<br>
That quaint in green she shall be loose enrobed,<br>
With ribands pendent, flaring 'bout her head;<br>
And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe,<br>
To pinch her by the hand, and, on that token,<br>
The maid hath given consent to go with him.
