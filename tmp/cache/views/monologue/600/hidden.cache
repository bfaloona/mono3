          My name is Caius Martius, who hath done <br>
To thee particularly and to all the Volsces<br>
Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness may<br>
My surname, Coriolanus: the painful service,<br>
The extreme dangers and the drops of blood<br>
Shed for my thankless country are requited <br>
But with that surname; a good memory,<br>
And witness of the malice and displeasure<br>
Which thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains;<br>
The cruelty and envy of the people,<br>
Permitted by our dastard nobles, who <br>
Have all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest;<br>
And suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to be<br>
Whoop'd out of Rome. Now this extremity<br>
Hath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope—<br>
Mistake me not—to save my life, for if <br>
I had fear'd death, of all the men i' the world<br>
I would have 'voided thee, but in mere spite,<br>
To be full quit of those my banishers,<br>
Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast<br>
A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge <br>
Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims<br>
Of shame seen through thy country, speed thee straight,<br>
And make my misery serve thy turn: so use it<br>
That my revengeful services may prove <br>
As benefits to thee, for I will fight<br>
Against my canker'd country with the spleen<br>
Of all the under fiends. But if so be<br>
Thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes<br>
Thou'rt tired, then, in a word, I also am <br>
Longer to live most weary, and present<br>
My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;<br>
Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,<br>
Since I have ever follow'd thee with hate,<br>
Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast, <br>
And cannot live but to thy shame, unless<br>
It be to do thee service.
