          <div align="right">Trumpet, blow loud,</div><br>
Send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents;<br>
And every Greek of mettle, let him know,<br>
What Troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud.<br>
[Trumpet sounds] <br>
We have, great Agamemnon, here in Troy<br>
A prince call'd Hector,â€”Priam is his father,â€”<br>
Who in this dull and long-continued truce<br>
Is rusty grown: he bade me take a trumpet,<br>
And to this purpose speak. Kings, princes, lords! <br>
If there be one among the fair'st of Greece<br>
That holds his honour higher than his ease,<br>
That seeks his praise more than he fears his peril,<br>
That knows his valour, and knows not his fear,<br>
That loves his mistress more than in confession, <br>
With truant vows to her own lips he loves,<br>
And dare avow her beauty and her worth<br>
In other arms than hers,â€”to him this challenge.<br>
Hector, in view of Trojans and of Greeks,<br>
Shall make it good, or do his best to do it, <br>
He hath a lady, wiser, fairer, truer,<br>
Than ever Greek did compass in his arms,<br>
And will to-morrow with his trumpet call<br>
Midway between your tents and walls of Troy,<br>
To rouse a Grecian that is true in love: <br>
If any come, Hector shall honour him;<br>
If none, he'll say in Troy when he retires,<br>
The Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth<br>
The splinter of a lance. Even so much.
