          This fellow's of exceeding honesty,<br>
And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit, <br>
Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,<br>
Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,<br>
I'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind,<br>
To pray at fortune. Haply, for I am black<br>
And have not those soft parts of conversation<br>
That chamberers have, or for I am declined<br>
Into the vale of years,—yet that's not much—<br>
She's gone. I am abused; and my relief<br>
Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,<br>
That we can call these delicate creatures ours,<br>
And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad,<br>
And live upon the vapour of a dungeon,<br>
Than keep a corner in the thing I love<br>
For others' uses. Yet, 'tis the plague of great ones;<br>
Prerogatived are they less than the base; <br>
'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death:<br>
Even then this forked plague is fated to us<br>
When we do quicken. Desdemona comes:<br>
[Re-enter DESDEMONA and EMILIA]<br>
If she be false, O, then heaven mocks itself! <br>
I'll not believe't. <br>
