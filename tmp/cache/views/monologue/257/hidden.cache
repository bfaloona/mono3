Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing,<br>
That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;<br>
Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.<br>
Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,<br>
I think it best you married with the county.<br>
O, he's a lovely gentleman! <br>
Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,<br>
Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye<br>
As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,<br>
I think you are happy in this second match,<br>
For it excels your first: or if it did not,<br>
Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,<br>
As living here and you no use of him.
