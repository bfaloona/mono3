          <b>Antony.</b> Since Cleopatra died,<br>
      I have lived in such dishonour, that the gods<br>
      Detest my baseness. I, that with my sword <br>
      Quarter'd the world, and o'er green Neptune's back<br>
      With ships made cities, condemn myself to lack<br>
      The courage of a woman; less noble mind<br>
      Than she which by her death our Caesar tells<br>
      'I am conqueror of myself.' Thou art sworn, Eros,<br>
      That, when the exigent should come, which now<br>
      Is come indeed, when I should see behind me<br>
      The inevitable prosecution of<br>
      Disgrace and horror, that, on my command,<br>
      Thou then wouldst kill me: do't; the time is come: <br>
      Thou strikest not me, 'tis Caesar thou defeat'st.<br>
      Put colour in thy cheek. <br><br>

<del><b>Eros.</b> The gods withhold me!<br>
      Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts,<br>
      Though enemy, lost aim, and could not? </del><br><br>

<b>Antony.</b><div align='right'> Eros,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
      Wouldst thou be window'd in great Rome and see<br>
      Thy master thus with pleach'd arms, bending down<br>
      His corrigible neck, his face subdued<br>
      To penetrative shame, whilst the wheel'd seat<br>
      Of fortunate Caesar, drawn before him, branded<br>
      His baseness that ensued? <br><br>

<del><b>Eros.</b> I would not see't. </del><br><br>

<b>Antony.</b> Come, then; for with a wound I must be cured.<br>
      Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn <br>
      Most useful for thy country.
