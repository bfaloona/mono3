          O rare instinct!  <br>
When shall I hear all through? This fierce abridgment <br>
Hath to it circumstantial branches, which <br>
Distinction should be rich in. Where? how liv'd you?<br> 
And when came you to serve our Roman captive?<br>
How parted with your brothers? how first met them?<br> 
Why fled you from the court, and whither? These, <br>
And your three motives to the battle, with <br>
I know not how much more, should be demanded, <br>
And all the other by-dependances, <br>
From chance to chance, but nor the time nor place<br> 
Will serve our long inter'gatories. See, <br>
Posthumus anchors upon Imogen, <br>
And she, like harmless lightning, throws her eye<br> 
On him, her brothers, me, her master, hitting <br>
Each object with a joy: the counterchange <br>
Is severally in all. Let's quit this ground, <br>
And smoke the temple with our sacrifices.<br>
