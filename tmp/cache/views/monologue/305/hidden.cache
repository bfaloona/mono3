          This forenam'd maid hath yet in her the continuance<br>
of her first affection: his unjust unkindness, that<br>
in all reason should have quenched her love, hath,<br>
like an impediment in the current, made it more<br>
violent and unruly. Go you to Angelo; answer his<br>
requiring with a plausible obedience; agree with <br>
his demands to the point; only refer yourself to<br>
this advantage, first, that your stay with him may<br>
not be long; that the time may have all shadow and<br>
silence in it; and the place answer to convenience.<br>
This being granted in course,â€”and now follows <br>
all,â€”we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up<br>
your appointment, go in your place; if the encounter<br>
acknowledge itself hereafter, it may compel him to<br>
her recompense: and here, by this, is your brother<br>
saved, your honour untainted, the poor Mariana <br>
advantaged, and the corrupt deputy scaled. The maid<br>
will I frame and make fit for his attempt. If you<br>
think well to carry this as you may, the doubleness<br>
of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof.<br>
What think you of it? <br>
