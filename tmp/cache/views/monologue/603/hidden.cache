          Now, you companion, I'll say an errand for you:<br>
You shall know now that I am in estimation; you shall<br>
perceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me from <br>
my son Coriolanus: guess, but by my entertainment<br>
with him, if thou standest not i' the state of<br>
hanging, or of some death more long in<br>
spectatorship, and crueller in suffering; behold now<br>
presently, and swoon for what's to come upon thee. <br>
[To CORIOLANUS]<br>
The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy<br>
particular prosperity, and love thee no worse than<br>
thy old father Menenius does! O my son, my son!<br>
thou art preparing fire for us; look thee, here's <br>
water to quench it. I was hardly moved to come to<br>
thee; but being assured none but myself could move<br>
thee, I have been blown out of your gates with<br>
sighs; and conjure thee to pardon Rome, and thy<br>
petitionary countrymen. The good gods assuage thy <br>
wrath, and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet<br>
here,â€”this, who, like a block, hath denied my<br>
access to thee.
