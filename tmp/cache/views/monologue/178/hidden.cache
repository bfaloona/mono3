Sweet Portia,
if you did know to whom I gave the ring

<div align=right>Sweet Portia,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
      If you did know to whom I gave the ring,<br>
      If you did know for whom I gave the ring<br>
      And would conceive for what I gave the ring<br>
      And how unwillingly I left the ring,<br>
      When nought would be accepted but the ring,<br>
      You would abate the strength of your displeasure.<br><br> 

    <del><b>Portia.</b> If you had known the virtue of the ring,<br>
      Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,<br>
      Or your own honour to contain the ring,<br>
      You would not then have parted with the ring.<br>
      What man is there so much unreasonable,<br>
      If you had pleased to have defended it<br>
      With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty<br>
      To urge the thing held as a ceremony?<br>
      Nerissa teaches me what to believe: <br>
      I'll die for't but some woman had the ring.</del><br><br> 

    <b>Bassanio.</b> <br>
      No, by my honour, madam, by my soul,<br>
      No woman had it, but a civil doctor,<br>
      Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me<br>
      And begg'd the ring; the which I did deny him <br>
      And suffer'd him to go displeased away;<br>
      Even he that did uphold the very life<br>
      Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady?<br>
      I was enforced to send it after him;<br>
      I was beset with shame and courtesy;<br>
      My honour would not let ingratitude<br>
      So much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady;<br>
      For, by these blessed candles of the night,<br>
      Had you been there, I think you would have begg'd<br>
      The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.
