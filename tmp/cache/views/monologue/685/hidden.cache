          Well, sir, I will; therefore, I will, sir; thus:<br>
If Alcibiades kill my countrymen,<br>
Let Alcibiades know this of Timon,<br>
That Timon cares not. But if be sack fair Athens,<br>
And take our goodly aged men by the beards,<br>
Giving our holy virgins to the stain<br>
Of contumelious, beastly, mad-brain'd war,<br>
Then let him know, and tell him Timon speaks it,<br>
In pity of our aged and our youth, <br>
I cannot choose but tell him, that I care not,<br>
And let him take't at worst; for their knives care not,<br>
While you have throats to answer: for myself,<br>
There's not a whittle in the unruly camp<br>
But I do prize it at my love before<br>
The reverend'st throat in Athens. So I leave you<br>
To the protection of the prosperous gods,<br>
As thieves to keepers.
