          O God! that one might read the book of fate,<br>
And see the revolution of the times<br>
Make mountains level, and the continent,<br>
Weary of solid firmness, melt itself<br>
Into the sea; and other times to see<br>
The beachy girdle of the ocean<br>
Too wide for Neptune's hips; how chances mock,<br>
And changes fill the cup of alteration<br>
With divers liquors! O, if this were seen,<br>
The happiest youth, viewing his progress through,<br>
What perils past, what crosses to ensue,<br>
Would shut the book and sit him down and die.<br>
'Tis not ten years gone<br>
Since Richard and Northumberland, great friends,<br>
Did feast together, and in two years after<br>
Were they at wars. It is but eight years since<br>
This Percy was the man nearest my soul;<br>
Who like a brother toil'd in my affairs<br>
And laid his love and life under my foot;<br>
Yea, for my sake, even to the eyes of Richard<br>
Gave him defiance. But which of you was byâ€”<br>
[To WARWICK] You, cousin Nevil, as I may rememberâ€”<br>
When Richard, with his eye brim full of tears,<br>
Then check'd and rated by Northumberland,<br>
Did speak these words, now prov'd a prophecy?<br>
'Northumberland, thou ladder by the which<br>
My cousin Bolingbroke ascends my throne'â€”<br>
Though then, God knows, I had no such intent<br>
But that necessity so bow'd the state<br>
That I and greatness were compell'd to kissâ€”<br>
'The time shall come'â€”thus did he follow itâ€”<br>
'The time will come that foul sin, gathering head,<br>
Shall break into corruption' so went on,<br>
Foretelling this same time's condition<br>
And the division of our amity.
