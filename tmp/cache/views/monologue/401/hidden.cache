          Proteus, I thank thee for thine honest care; <br>
Which to requite, command me while I live.<br>
This love of theirs myself have often seen,<br>
Haply when they have judged me fast asleep,<br>
And oftentimes have purposed to forbid<br>
Sir Valentine her company and my court: <br>
But fearing lest my jealous aim might err<br>
And so unworthily disgrace the man,<br>
A rashness that I ever yet have shunn'd,<br>
I gave him gentle looks, thereby to find<br>
That which thyself hast now disclosed to me. <br>
And, that thou mayst perceive my fear of this,<br>
Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested,<br>
I nightly lodge her in an upper tower,<br>
The key whereof myself have ever kept;<br>
And thence she cannot be convey'd away.
