          O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs<br>
All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,<br>
When sorrows come, they come not single spies.<br>
But in battalions! First, her father slain; <br>
Next, your son gone, and he most violent author<br>
Of his own just remove; the people muddied,<br>
Thick and and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers<br>
For good Polonius' death, and we have done but greenly<br>
In hugger-mugger to inter him; poor Ophelia <br>
Divided from herself and her fair judgment,<br>
Without the which we are pictures or mere beasts;<br>
Last, and as much containing as all these,<br>
Her brother is in secret come from France;<br>
Feeds on his wonder, keeps, himself in clouds,<br>
And wants not buzzers to infect his ear<br>
With pestilent speeches of his father's death,<br>
Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,<br>
Will nothing stick our person to arraign<br>
In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,<br>
Like to a murd'ring piece, in many places<br>
Give me superfluous death.<br>
