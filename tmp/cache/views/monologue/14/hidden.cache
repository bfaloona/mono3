          Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know,<br>
When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul<br>
Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter,<br>
Giving more light than heat, extinct in both <br>
Even in their promise, as it is a-making,<br>
You must not take for fire. From this time<br>
Be something scanter of your maiden presence.<br>
Set your entreatments at a higher rate<br>
Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,<br>
Believe so much in him, that he is young,<br>
And with a larger tether may he walk<br>
Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,<br>
Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,<br>
Not of that dye which their investments show, <br>
But mere implorators of unholy suits,<br>
Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,<br>
The better to beguile. This is for all:<br>
I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth<br>
Have you so slander any moment leisure <br>
As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.<br>
Look to't, I charge you. Come your ways. <br>
