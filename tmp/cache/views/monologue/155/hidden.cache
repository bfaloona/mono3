          Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief;<br>
And by these badges understand the king.<br>
For your fair sakes have we neglected time, <br>
Play'd foul play with our oaths: your beauty, ladies,<br>
Hath much deform'd us, fashioning our humours<br>
Even to the opposed end of our intents:<br>
And what in us hath seem'd ridiculous,--<br>
As love is full of unbefitting strains, <br>
All wanton as a child, skipping and vain,<br>
Form'd by the eye and therefore, like the eye,<br>
Full of strange shapes, of habits and of forms,<br>
Varying in subjects as the eye doth roll<br>
To every varied object in his glance: <br>
Which parti-coated presence of loose love<br>
Put on by us, if, in your heavenly eyes,<br>
Have misbecomed our oaths and gravities,<br>
Those heavenly eyes, that look into these faults,<br>
Suggested us to make. Therefore, ladies, <br>
Our love being yours, the error that love makes<br>
Is likewise yours: we to ourselves prove false,<br>
By being once false for ever to be true<br>
To those that make us both,--fair ladies, you:<br>
And even that falsehood, in itself a sin,<br>
Thus purifies itself and turns to grace.
