          Could great men thunder <br>
As Jove himself does, Jove would ne'er be quiet,<br>
For every pelting, petty officer<br>
Would use his heaven for thunder;<br>
Nothing but thunder! Merciful Heaven,<br>
Thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt<br>
Split'st the unwedgeable and gnarled oak<br>
Than the soft myrtle: but man, proud man,<br>
Drest in a little brief authority,<br>
Most ignorant of what he's most assured,<br>
His glassy essence, like an angry ape,<br>
Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven<br>
As make the angels weep; who, with our spleens,<br>
Would all themselves laugh mortal. <br>
