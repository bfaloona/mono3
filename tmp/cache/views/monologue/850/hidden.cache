          What's this, what's this? Is this her fault or mine?<br>
The tempter or the tempted, who sins most?<br>
Ha!<br>
Not she: nor doth she tempt: but it is I<br>
That, lying by the violet in the sun, <br>
Do as the carrion does, not as the flower,<br>
Corrupt with virtuous season. Can it be<br>
That modesty may more betray our sense<br>
Than woman's lightness? Having waste ground enough,<br>
Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary <br>
And pitch our evils there? O, fie, fie, fie!<br>
What dost thou, or what art thou, Angelo?<br>
Dost thou desire her foully for those things<br>
That make her good? O, let her brother live!<br>
Thieves for their robbery have authority <br>
When judges steal themselves. What, do I love her,<br>
That I desire to hear her speak again,<br>
And feast upon her eyes? What is't I dream on?<br>
O cunning enemy, that, to catch a saint,<br>
With saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerous <br>
Is that temptation that doth goad us on<br>
To sin in loving virtue: never could the strumpet,<br>
With all her double vigour, art and nature,<br>
Once stir my temper; but this virtuous maid<br>
Subdues me quite. Even till now, <br>
When men were fond, I smiled and wonder'd how. <br>
