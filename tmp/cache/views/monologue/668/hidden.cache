          O, no doubt, my good friends, but the gods<br>
themselves have provided that I shall have much help<br>
from you: how had you been my friends else? why<br>
have you that charitable title from thousands, did<br>
not you chiefly belong to my heart? I have told <br>
more of you to myself than you can with modesty<br>
speak in your own behalf; and thus far I confirm<br>
you. O you gods, think I, what need we have any<br>
friends, if we should ne'er have need of 'em? they<br>
were the most needless creatures living, should we <br>
ne'er have use for 'em, and would most resemble<br>
sweet instruments hung up in cases that keep their<br>
sounds to themselves. Why, I have often wished<br>
myself poorer, that I might come nearer to you. We<br>
are born to do benefits: and what better or <br>
properer can we can our own than the riches of our<br>
friends? O, what a precious comfort 'tis, to have<br>
so many, like brothers, commanding one another's<br>
fortunes! O joy, e'en made away ere 't can be born!<br>
Mine eyes cannot hold out water, methinks: to <br>
forget their faults, I drink to you.
