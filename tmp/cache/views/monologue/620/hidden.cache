          No, not an oath: if not the face of men,<br>
The sufferance of our souls, the time's abuse,â€”<br>
If these be motives weak, break off betimes,<br>
And every man hence to his idle bed; <br>
So let high-sighted tyranny range on,<br>
Till each man drop by lottery. But if these,<br>
As I am sure they do, bear fire enough<br>
To kindle cowards and to steel with valour<br>
The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen, <br>
What need we any spur but our own cause,<br>
To prick us to redress? what other bond<br>
Than secret Romans, that have spoke the word,<br>
And will not palter? and what other oath<br>
Than honesty to honesty engaged, <br>
That this shall be, or we will fall for it?<br>
Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous,<br>
Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls<br>
That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear<br>
Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain <br>
The even virtue of our enterprise,<br>
Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits,<br>
To think that or our cause or our performance<br>
Did need an oath; when every drop of blood<br>
That every Roman bears, and nobly bears, <br>
Is guilty of a several bastardy,<br>
If he do break the smallest particle<br>
Of any promise that hath pass'd from him.
