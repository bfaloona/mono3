          <del>Despise me, if I do not.</del> Three great ones of the city,<br>
In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,<br>
Off-capp'd to him: and, by the faith of man, <br>
I know my price, I am worth no worse a place:<br>
But he; as loving his own pride and purposes,<br>
Evades them, with a bombast circumstance<br>
Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war;<br>
And, in conclusion, Nonsuits my mediators; <br>
for, 'Certes,' says he, 'I have already chose my officer.'<br>
And what was he? Forsooth, a great arithmetician,<br>
One Michael Cassio, a Florentine, <br>
A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife;<br>
That never set a squadron in the field,<br>
Nor the division of a battle knows<br>
More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,<br>
Wherein the toged consuls can propose <br>
As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise,<br>
Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election:<br>
And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof<br>
At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds<br>
Christian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd <br>
By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,<br>
He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,<br>
And Iâ€”God bless the mark!â€”his Moorship's ancient. <br>
