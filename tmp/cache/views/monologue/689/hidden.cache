           Now climbeth Tamora Olympus' top,<br>
Safe out of fortune's shot; and sits aloft,<br>
Secure of thunder's crack or lightning flash;<br>
Advanced above pale envy's threatening reach.<br>
As when the golden sun salutes the morn,<br>
And, having gilt the ocean with his beams,<br>
Gallops the zodiac in his glistering coach,<br>
And overlooks the highest-peering hills;<br>
So Tamora: Upon her wit doth earthly honour wait,<br>
And virtue stoops and trembles at her frown.<br>
Then, Aaron, arm thy heart, and fit thy thoughts,<br>
To mount aloft with thy imperial mistress, <br>
And mount her pitch, whom thou in triumph long<br>
Hast prisoner held, fetter'd in amorous chains<br>
And faster bound to Aaron's charming eyes<br>
Than is Prometheus tied to Caucasus.<br>
Away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts! <br>
I will be bright, and shine in pearl and gold,<br>
To wait upon this new-made empress.<br>
To wait, said I? to wanton with this queen,<br>
This goddess, this Semiramis, this nymph,<br>
This siren, that will charm Rome's Saturnine, <br>
And see his shipwreck and his commonweal's.<br>
Holloa! what storm is this?
