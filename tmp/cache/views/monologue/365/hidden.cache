          Now my charms are all o'erthrown,<br>
And what strength I have's mine own, <br>
Which is most faint: now, 'tis true,<br>
I must be here confined by you,<br>
Or sent to Naples. Let me not,<br>
Since I have my dukedom got<br>
And pardon'd the deceiver, dwell <br>
In this bare island by your spell;<br>
But release me from my bands<br>
With the help of your good hands:<br>
Gentle breath of yours my sails<br>
Must fill, or else my project fails,<br>
Which was to please. Now I want<br>
Spirits to enforce, art to enchant,<br>
And my ending is despair,<br>
Unless I be relieved by prayer,<br>
Which pierces so that it assaults <br>
Mercy itself and frees all faults.<br>
As you from crimes would pardon'd be,<br>
Let your indulgence set me free.
