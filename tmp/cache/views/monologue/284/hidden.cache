          Ay, so thou dost,<br>
Italian fiend! Ay me, most credulous fool,<br>
Egregious murderer, thief, any thing <br>
That's due to all the villains past, in being,<br>
To come! O, give me cord, or knife, or poison,<br>
Some upright justicer! Thou, king, send out<br>
For torturers ingenious: it is I<br>
That all the abhorred things o' the earth amend<br>
By being worse than they. I am Posthumus,<br>
That kill'd thy daughter:â€”villain-like, I lieâ€”<br>
That caused a lesser villain than myself,<br>
A sacrilegious thief, to do't: the temple<br>
Of virtue was she; yea, and she herself. <br>
Spit, and throw stones, cast mire upon me, set<br>
The dogs o' the street to bay me: every villain<br>
Be call'd Posthumus Leonitus; and<br>
Be villany less than 'twas! O Imogen!<br>
My queen, my life, my wife! O Imogen, <br>
Imogen, Imogen!
