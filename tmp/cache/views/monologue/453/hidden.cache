      <div class="monologue_preview">
          Now entertain conjecture of a time<br>
When creeping murmur and the poring dark<br>
Fills the wide vessel of the universe. <br>
From camp to camp through the foul womb of night<br>
The hum of either army stilly sounds,<br>
That the fixed sentinels almost receive<br>
The secret whispers of each other's watch:<br>
Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames <br>
Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;<br>
Steed threatens steed, in high and boastful neighs<br>
Piercing the night's dull ear, and from the tents<br>
The armourers, accomplishing the knights,<br>
With busy hammers closing rivets up, <br>
Give dreadful note of preparation:<br>
The country cocks do crow, the clocks do toll,<br>
And the third hour of drowsy morning name.<br>
Proud of their numbers and secure in soul,<br>
The confident and over-lusty French <br>
Do the low-rated English play at dice;<br>
And chide the cripple tardy-gaited night<br>
Who, like a foul and ugly witch, doth limp<br>
So tediously away. The poor condemned English,<br>
Like sacrifices, by their watchful fires <br>
Sit patiently and inly ruminate<br>
The morning's danger, and their gesture sad<br>
Investing lank-lean; cheeks and war-worn coats<br>
Presenteth them unto the gazing moon<br>
So many horrid ghosts. O now, who will behold <br>
The royal captain of this ruin'd band<br>
Walking from watch to watch, from tent to tent,<br>
Let him cry 'Praise and glory on his head!'<br>
For forth he goes and visits all his host.<br>
Bids them good morrow with a modest smile <br>
And calls them brothers, friends and countrymen.<br>
Upon his royal face there is no note<br>
How dread an army hath enrounded him;<br>
Nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour<br>
Unto the weary and all-watched night, <br>
But freshly looks and over-bears attaint<br>
With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty;<br>
That every wretch, pining and pale before,<br>
Beholding him, plucks comfort from his looks:<br>
A largess universal like the sun <br>
His liberal eye doth give to every one,<br>
Thawing cold fear, that mean and gentle all,<br>
Behold, as may unworthiness define,<br>
A little touch of Harry in the night.<br>
And so our scene must to the battle fly; <br>
Whereâ€”O for pity!â€”we shall much disgrace<br>
With four or five most vile and ragged foils,<br>
Right ill-disposed in brawl ridiculous,<br>
The name of Agincourt. Yet sit and see,<br>
Minding true things by what their mockeries be.
