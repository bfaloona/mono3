          Sir, I will answer any thing. But, I beseech you,<br>
If't be your pleasure and most wise consent,<br>
As partly I find it is, that your fair daughter,<br>
At this odd-even and dull watch o' the night,<br>
Transported, with no worse nor better guard <br>
But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,<br>
To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moorâ€”<br>
If this be known to you and your allowance,<br>
We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;<br>
But if you know not this, my manners tell me <br>
We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe<br>
That, from the sense of all civility,<br>
I thus would play and trifle with your reverence:<br>
Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,<br>
I say again, hath made a gross revolt; <br>
Tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunes<br>
In an extravagant and wheeling stranger<br>
Of here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself:<br>
If she be in her chamber or your house,<br>
Let loose on me the justice of the state <br>
For thus deluding you. <br>
