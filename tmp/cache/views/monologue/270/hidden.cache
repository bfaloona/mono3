          Peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not<br>
In these confusions. Heaven and yourself<br>
Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all,<br>
And all the better is it for the maid:<br>
Your part in her you could not keep from death,<br>
But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.<br>
The most you sought was her promotion; <br>
For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced:<br>
And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced<br>
Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?<br>
O, in this love, you love your child so ill,<br>
That you run mad, seeing that she is well: <br>
She's not well married that lives married long;<br>
But she's best married that dies married young.<br>
Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary<br>
On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,<br>
In all her best array bear her to church: <br>
For though fond nature bids us an lament,<br>
Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.
