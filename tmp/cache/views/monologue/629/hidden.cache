          Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up<br>
To such a sudden flood of mutiny. <br>
They that have done this deed are honourable:<br>
What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,<br>
That made them do it: they are wise and honourable,<br>
And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.<br>
I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts: <br>
I am no orator, as Brutus is;<br>
But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,<br>
That love my friend; and that they know full well<br>
That gave me public leave to speak of him:<br>
For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth, <br>
Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,<br>
To stir men's blood: I only speak right on;<br>
I tell you that which you yourselves do know;<br>
Show you sweet Caesar's wounds, poor poor dumb mouths,<br>
And bid them speak for me: but were I Brutus, <br>
And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony<br>
Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue<br>
In every wound of Caesar that should move<br>
The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.
