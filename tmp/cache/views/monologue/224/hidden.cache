          With three or four loggerheads amongst three or four<br>
score hogsheads. I have sounded the very<br>
base-string of humility. Sirrah, I am sworn brother<br>
to a leash of drawers; and can call them all by<br>
their christen names, as Tom, Dick, and Francis.<br>
They take it already upon their salvation, that<br>
though I be but the prince of Wales, yet I am king<br>
of courtesy; and tell me flatly I am no proud Jack,<br>
like Falstaff, but a Corinthian, a lad of mettle, a<br>
good boy, by the Lord, so they call me, and when I<br>
am king of England, I shall command all the good<br>
lads in Eastcheap. They call drinking deep, dyeing<br>
scarlet; and when you breathe in your watering, they<br>
cry 'hem!' and bid you play it off. To conclude, I<br>
am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour,<br>
that I can drink with any tinker in his own language<br>
during my life. I tell thee, Ned, thou hast lost<br>
much honour, that thou wert not with me in this sweet<br>
action. But, sweet Ned,.to sweeten which name of<br>
Ned, I give thee this pennyworth of sugar, clapped<br>
even now into my hand by an under-skinker, one that<br>
never spake other English in his life than 'Eight<br>
shillings and sixpence' and 'You are welcome,' with<br>
this shrill addition, 'Anon, anon, sir! Score a pint<br>
of bastard in the Half-Moon,' or so. But, Ned, to<br>
drive away the time till Falstaff come, I prithee,<br>
do thou stand in some by-room, while I question my<br>
puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar; and do<br>
thou never leave calling 'Francis,' that his tale<br>
to me may be nothing but 'Anon.' Step aside, and<br>
I'll show thee a precedent.
