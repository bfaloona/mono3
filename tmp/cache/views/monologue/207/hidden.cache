          O, what a deal of scorn looks beautiful<br>
In the contempt and anger of his lip!<br>
A murderous guilt shows not itself more soon<br>
Than love that would seem hid: love's night is noon.<br>
Cesario, by the roses of the spring,<br>
By maidhood, honour, truth and every thing,<br>
I love thee so, that, maugre all thy pride, <br>
Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide.<br>
Do not extort thy reasons from this clause,<br>

For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause,<br>
But rather reason thus with reason fetter,<br>
Love sought is good, but given unsought better.
