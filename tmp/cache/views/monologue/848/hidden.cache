           <b>Macbeth.</b> I have almost forgot the taste of fears;<br> 
      The time has been, my senses would have cool'd <br> 
      To hear a night-shriek; and my fell of hair<br> 
      Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir<br> 
      As life were in't: I have supp'd full with horrors;<br> 
      Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts<br> 
      Cannot once start me. <br> 
      [Re-enter SEYTON]<br> 
      Wherefore was that cry?
<br><br> 
    <del><b>Seyton.</b> The queen, my lord, is dead.</del> 
<br><br> 
    <b>Macbeth.</b> She should have died hereafter;<br> 
      There would have been a time for such a word.<br> 
      To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,<br> 
      Creeps in this petty pace from day to day<br> 
      To the last syllable of recorded time,<br> 
      And all our yesterdays have lighted fools<br> 
      The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!<br> 
      Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player<br> 
      That struts and frets his hour upon the stage<br> 
      And then is heard no more: it is a tale<br> 
      Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,<br> 
      Signifying nothing. <br>
