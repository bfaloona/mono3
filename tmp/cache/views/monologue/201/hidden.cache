          They shall go forward, Kate, at thy command.<br>
Obey the bride, you that attend on her;<br>
Go to the feast, revel and domineer, <br>
Carouse full measure to her maidenhead;<br>
Be mad and merry, or go hang yourselves.<br>
But for my bonny Kate, she must with me.<br>
Nay, look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret;<br>
I will be master of what is mine own- <br>
She is my goods, my chattels, she is my house,<br>
My household stuff, my field, my barn,<br>
My horse, my ox, my ass, my any thing,<br>
And here she stands; touch her whoever dare;<br>
I'll bring mine action on the proudest he <br>
That stops my way in Padua. Grumio,<br>
Draw forth thy weapon; we are beset with thieves;<br>
Rescue thy mistress, if thou be a man.<br>
Fear not, sweet wench; they shall not touch thee, Kate;<br>
I'll buckler thee against a million.
