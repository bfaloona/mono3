My lord, that ne'er before invited eyes,<br>
But have been gazed on like a comet: she speaks,<br>
My lord, that, may be, hath endured a grief<br>
Might equal yours, if both were justly weigh'd.<br>
Though wayward fortune did malign my state,<br>
My derivation was from ancestors<br>
Who stood equivalent with mighty kings:<br>
But time hath rooted out my parentage,<br>
And to the world and awkward casualties<br>
Bound me in servitude.<br>
[Aside]<br>
I will desist;<br>
But there is something glows upon my cheek,<br>
And whispers in mine ear, 'Go not till he speak.'
