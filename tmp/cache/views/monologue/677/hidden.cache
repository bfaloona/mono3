          Put up thy gold: go on,‚Äîhere's gold,‚Äîgo on;<br>
Be as a planetary plague, when Jove<br>
Will o'er some high-viced city hang his poison<br>
In the sick air: let not thy sword skip one: <br>
Pity not honour'd age for his white beard;<br>
He is an usurer: strike me the counterfeit matron;<br>
It is her habit only that is honest,<br>
Herself's a bawd: let not the virgin's cheek<br>
Make soft thy trenchant sword; for those milk-paps, <br>
That through the window-bars bore at men's eyes,<br>
Are not within the leaf of pity writ,<br>
But set them down horrible traitors: spare not the babe,<br>
Whose dimpled smiles from fools exhaust their mercy;<br>
Think it a bastard, whom the oracle <br>
Hath doubtfully pronounced thy throat shall cut,<br>
And mince it sans remorse: swear against objects;<br>
Put armour on thine ears and on thine eyes;<br>
Whose proof, nor yells of mothers, maids, nor babes,<br>
Nor sight of priests in holy vestments bleeding, <br>
Shall pierce a jot. There's gold to pay soldiers:<br>
Make large confusion; and, thy fury spent,<br>
Confounded be thyself! Speak not, be gone.
