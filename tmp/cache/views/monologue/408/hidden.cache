      <div class="monologue_preview">
          Say that upon the altar of her beauty <br>
You sacrifice your tears, your sighs, your heart:<br>
Write till your ink be dry, and with your tears<br>
Moist it again, and frame some feeling line<br>
That may discover such integrity:<br>
For Orpheus' lute was strung with poets' sinews, <br>
Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones,<br>
Make tigers tame and huge leviathans<br>
Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands.<br>
After your dire-lamenting elegies,<br>
Visit by night your lady's chamber-window <br>
With some sweet concert; to their instruments<br>
Tune a deploring dump: the night's dead silence<br>
Will well become such sweet-complaining grievance.<br>
This, or else nothing, will inherit her.
