          And may it be that you have quite forgot <br>
  A husband's office? Shall, Antipholus,<br>
Even in the spring of love, thy love-springs rot?<br>    
  Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous? <br>
If you did wed my sister for her wealth, <br>
  Then, for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness:<br>
Or, if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth;<br>
  Muffle your false love with some show of blindness; <br>
Let not my sister read it in your eye; <br>
  Be not thy tongue thy own shame's orator;<br>
Look sweet, speak fair, become disloyalty; <br>
  Apparel vice like virtue's harbinger; <br>
Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted;<br> 
  Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint; <br>
Be secret-false: what need she be acquainted? <br>
  What simple thief brags of his own attaint?  <br>
'Tis double wrong to truant with your bed,<br> 
  And let her read it in thy looks at board: <br>
Shame hath a bastard fame, well managed; <br>
  Ill deeds are doubled with an evil word. <br>
Alas! poor women, make us but believe, <br>
  Being compact of credit, that you love us;<br>
Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve; <br>
  We in your motion turn, and you may move us. <br>
Then, gentle brother, get you in again; <br>
  Comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife: <br>
'Tis holy sport to be a little vain,  <br>
  When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.
