          <b>Vincentio.</b> No, holy father; throw away that thought; <br>
 Believe not that the dribbling dart of love<br>
 Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee<br>
 To give me secret harbour, hath a purpose<br>
 More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends<br>
 Of burning youth.<br>
<br>
<del><b>Friar Thomas.</b> May your grace speak of it?</del> <br>
<br>
<b>Vincentio.</b> My holy sir, none better knows than you<br>
 How I have ever loved the life removed<br>
 And held in idle price to haunt assemblies<br>
 Where youth, and cost, and witless bravery keeps.<br>
 I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo,<br>
 A man of stricture and firm abstinence,<br>
 My absolute power and place here in Vienna,<br>
 And he supposes me travell'd to Poland;<br>
 For so I have strew'd it in the common ear,<br>
 And so it is received. Now, pious sir,<br>
 You will demand of me why I do this? <br>
<br>
<del><b>Friar Thomas.</b> Gladly, my lord. </del><br>
<br>
<b>Vincentio.</b> We have strict statutes and most biting laws.<br>
 The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds, <br>
 Which for this nineteen years we have let slip;<br>
 Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave,<br>
 That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,<br>
 Having bound up the threatening twigs of birch,<br>
 Only to stick it in their children's sight <br>
 For terror, not to use, in time the rod<br>
 Becomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees,<br>
 Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead;<br>
 And liberty plucks justice by the nose;<br>
 The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart <br>
 Goes all decorum.
