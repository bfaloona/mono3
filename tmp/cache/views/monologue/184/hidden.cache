          Wherefore! Why, doth not every earthly thing<br>
Cry shame upon her? Could she here deny<br>
The story that is printed in her blood?<br>
Do not live, Hero; do not ope thine eyes:<br>
For, did I think thou wouldst not quickly die,<br>
Thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames,<br>
Myself would, on the rearward of reproaches, <br>
Strike at thy life. Grieved I, I had but one?<br>
Chid I for that at frugal nature's frame?<br>
O, one too much by thee! Why had I one?<br>
Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes?<br>
Why had I not with charitable hand <br>
Took up a beggar's issue at my gates,<br>
Who smirch'd thus and mired with infamy,<br>
I might have said 'No part of it is mine;<br>
This shame derives itself from unknown loins'?<br>
But mine and mine I loved and mine I praised <br>
And mine that I was proud on, mine so much<br>
That I myself was to myself not mine,<br>
Valuing of her,.why, she, O, she is fallen<br>
Into a pit of ink, that the wide sea<br>
Hath drops too few to wash her clean again <br>
And salt too little which may season give<br>
To her foul-tainted flesh!
