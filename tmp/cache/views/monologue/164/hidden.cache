          <b>Bassanio.</b> 'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,<br>
      How much I have disabled mine estate, <br>
      By something showing a more swelling port<br>
      Than my faint means would grant continuance:<br>
      Nor do I now make moan to be abridged<br>
      From such a noble rate; but my chief care<br>
      Is to come fairly off from the great debts<br>
      Wherein my time something too prodigal<br>
      Hath left me gaged. To you, Antonio,<br>
      I owe the most, in money and in love,<br>
      And from your love I have a warranty<br>
      To unburden all my plots and purposes<br>
      How to get clear of all the debts I owe. <br><br>

   <del> <b>Antonio.</b> I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;<br>
      And if it stand, as you yourself still do,<br>
      Within the eye of honour, be assured,<br>
      My purse, my person, my extremest means, <br>
      Lie all unlock'd to your occasions. </del><br><br>

 <b>Bassanio.</b> In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,<br>
      I shot his fellow of the self-same flight<br>
      The self-same way with more advised watch,<br>
      To find the other forth, and by adventuring both<br>
      I oft found both: I urge this childhood proof,<br>
      Because what follows is pure innocence.<br>
      I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,<br>
      That which I owe is lost; but if you please<br>
      To shoot another arrow that self way <br>
      Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,<br>
      As I will watch the aim, or to find both<br>
      Or bring your latter hazard back again<br>
      And thankfully rest debtor for the first. <br><br>

<del>    <b>Antonio.</b> You know me well, and herein spend but time<br>
      To wind about my love with circumstance;<br>
      And out of doubt you do me now more wrong<br>
      In making question of my uttermost<br>
      Than if you had made waste of all I have:<br>
      Then do but say to me what I should do <br>
      That in your knowledge may by me be done,<br>
      And I am prest unto it: therefore, speak. </del><br><br>

    <b>Bassanio.</b> In Belmont is a lady richly left;<br>
      And she is fair, and, fairer than that word,<br>
      Of wondrous virtues: sometimes from her eyes <br>
      I did receive fair speechless messages:<br>
      Her name is Portia, nothing undervalued<br>
      To Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia:<br>
      Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,<br>
      For the four winds blow in from every coast <br>
      Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks<br>
      Hang on her temples like a golden fleece;<br>
      Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos' strand,<br>
      And many Jasons come in quest of her.<br>
      O my Antonio, had I but the means <br>
      To hold a rival place with one of them,<br>
      I have a mind presages me such thrift,<br>
      That I should questionless be fortunate!
