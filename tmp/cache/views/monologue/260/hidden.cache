          Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,<br>
Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--<br>
Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,<br>
That quench the fire of your pernicious rage<br>
With purple fountains issuing from your veins, <br>
On pain of torture, from those bloody hands<br>
Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,<br>
And hear the sentence of your moved prince.<br>
Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,<br>
By thee, old Capulet, and Montague, <br>
Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,<br>
And made Verona's ancient citizens<br>
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,<br>
To wield old partisans, in hands as old,<br>
Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:<br>
If ever you disturb our streets again,<br>
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.<br>
For this time, all the rest depart away:<br>
You Capulet; shall go along with me:<br>
And, Montague, come you this afternoon, <br>
To know our further pleasure in this case,<br>
To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.<br>
Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
