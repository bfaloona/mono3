          <b>First Stranger.</b> Why, this is the world's soul; and just of the
      same piece 
      Is every flatterer's spirit. Who can call him
      His friend that dips in the same dish? for, in
      My knowing, Timon has been this lord's father,
      And kept his credit with his purse,
      Supported his estate; nay, Timon's money 
      Has paid his men their wages: he ne'er drinks,
      But Timon's silver treads upon his lip;
      And yet—O, see the monstrousness of man
      When he looks out in an ungrateful shape!—
      He does deny him, in respect of his, 
      What charitable men afford to beggars. 
<p>
<del><b>Third Stranger.</b> Religion groans at it. </del>
<p>
<b>First Stranger.</b> For mine own part,
      I never tasted Timon in my life,
      Nor came any of his bounties over me,
      To mark me for his friend; yet, I protest,
      For his right noble mind, illustrious virtue
      And honourable carriage,
      Had his necessity made use of me,
      I would have put my wealth into donation, 
      And the best half should have return'd to him,
      So much I love his heart: but, I perceive,
      Men must learn now with pity to dispense;
      For policy sits above conscience.
