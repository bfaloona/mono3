      <div class="monologue_preview">
          Neither of either; I remit both twain.<br>
I see the trick on't: here was a consent,<br>
Knowing aforehand of our merriment,<br>
To dash it like a Christmas comedy:<br>
Some carry-tale, some please-man, some slight zany,<br>
Some mumble-news, some trencher-knight, some Dick,<br>
That smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick<br>
To make my lady laugh when she's disposed,<br>
Told our intents before; which once disclosed,<br>
The ladies did change favours: and then we, <br>
Following the signs, woo'd but the sign of she.<br>
Now, to our perjury to add more terror,<br>
We are again forsworn, in will and error.<br>
Much upon this it is: and might not you<br>
<i>[To BOYET]</i><br>
Forestall our sport, to make us thus untrue?<br>
Do not you know my lady's foot by the squier,<br>
And laugh upon the apple of her eye?<br>
And stand between her back, sir, and the fire,<br>
Holding a trencher, jesting merrily? <br>
You put our page out: go, you are allow'd;<br>
Die when you will, a smock shall be your shroud.<br>
You leer upon me, do you? there's an eye<br>
Wounds like a leaden sword.
