          Give me my robe, put on my crown; I have<br>
Immortal longings in me: now no more<br>
The juice of Egypt's grape shall moist this lip:<br>
Yare, yare, good Iras; quick. Methinks I hear<br>
Antony call; I see him rouse himself<br>
To praise my noble act; I hear him mock<br>
The luck of Caesar, which the gods give men<br>
To excuse their after wrath: husband, I come:<br>
Now to that name my courage prove my title!<br>
I am fire and air; my other elements<br>
I give to baser life. So; have you done?<br>
Come then, and take the last warmth of my lips.<br>
Farewell, kind Charmian; Iras, long farewell. <br>
[Kisses them. IRAS falls and dies]<br>
Have I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall?<br>
If thou and nature can so gently part,<br>
The stroke of death is as a lover's pinch,<br>
Which hurts, and is desired. Dost thou lie still?<br>
If thus thou vanishest, thou tell'st the world<br>
It is not worth leave-taking.
