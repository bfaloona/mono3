          Hear you, Patroclus: <br>
We are too well acquainted with these answers:<br>
But his evasion, wing'd thus swift with scorn,<br>
Cannot outfly our apprehensions.<br>
Much attribute he hath, and much the reason<br>
Why we ascribe it to him; yet all his virtues, <br>
Not virtuously on his own part beheld,<br>
Do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss,<br>
Yea, like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish,<br>
Are like to rot untasted. Go and tell him,<br>
We come to speak with him; and you shall not sin,<br>
If you do say we think him over-proud<br>
And under-honest, in self-assumption greater<br>
Than in the note of judgment; and worthier than himself<br>
Here tend the savage strangeness he puts on, <br>
Disguise the holy strength of their command,<br>
And underwrite in an observing kind<br>
His humorous predominance; yea, watch<br>
His pettish lunes, his ebbs, his flows, as if<br>
The passage and whole carriage of this action <br>
Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,<br>
That if he overhold his price so much,<br>
We'll none of him; but let him, like an engine<br>
Not portable, lie under this report:<br>
'Bring action hither, this cannot go to war: <br>
A stirring dwarf we do allowance give<br>
Before a sleeping giant.' Tell him so.
