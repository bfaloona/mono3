          I see a man's life is a tedious one;<br>
I have tir'd myself, and for two nights together <br>
Have made the ground my bed; I should be sick <br>
But that my resolution helps me. Milford, <br>
When from the mountain-top Pisanio show'd thee,<br> 
Thou wast within a ken. O Jove! I think  <br>
Foundations fly the wretched; such, I mean, <br>
Where they should be reliev'd. Two beggars told me<br> 
I could not miss my way; will poor folks lie, <br>
That have afflictions on them, knowing 'tis  <br>
A punishment or trial? Yes; no wonder,  <br>
When rich ones scarce tell true. To lapse in fulness<br> 
Is sorer than to lie for need, and falsehood  <br>
Is worse in kings than beggars. My dear lord!  <br>
Thou art one o' the false ones. Now I think on thee, <br>
My hunger's gone, but even before I was <br>
At point to sink for food. But what is this?<br> 
Here is a path to 't; 'tis some savage hold;   <br>
I were best not call, I dare not call, yet famine, <br>
Ere clean it o'erthrow nature, makes it valiant. <br>
Plenty and peace breeds cowards, hardness ever <br>
Of hardiness is mother. Ho! Who's here?  <br>
If any thing that's civil, speak; if savage, <br>
Take or lend. Ho! No answer? Then I'll enter. <br>
Best draw my sword; and if mine enemy <br>
But fear the sword like me, he'll scarcely look on 't.<br>
Such a foe, good heavens! <br>
