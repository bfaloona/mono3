      <div class="monologue_preview">
           Because that now it lies you on to speak<br>
To the people; not by your own instruction,<br>
Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you,<br>
But with such words that are but rooted in<br>
Your tongue, though but bastards and syllables<br>
Of no allowance to your bosom's truth.<br>
Now, this no more dishonours you at all<br>
Than to take in a town with gentle words,<br>
Which else would put you to your fortune and<br>
The hazard of much blood. <br>
I would dissemble with my nature where<br>
My fortunes and my friends at stake required<br>
I should do so in honour: I am in this,<br>
Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;<br>
And you will rather show our general louts <br>
How you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em,<br>
For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard<br>
Of what that want might ruin.
