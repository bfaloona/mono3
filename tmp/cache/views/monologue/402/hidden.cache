          A woman sometimes scorns what best contents her.<br>
Send her another; never give her o'er;<br>
For scorn at first makes after-love the more. <br>
If she do frown, 'tis not in hate of you,<br>
But rather to beget more love in you:<br>
If she do chide, 'tis not to have you gone;<br>
For why, the fools are mad, if left alone.<br>
Take no repulse, whatever she doth say; <br>
For 'get you gone,' she doth not mean 'away!'<br>
Flatter and praise, commend, extol their graces;<br>
Though ne'er so black, say they have angels' faces.<br>
That man that hath a tongue, I say, is no man,<br>
If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.
