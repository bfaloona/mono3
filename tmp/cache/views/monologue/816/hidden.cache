          This admiration, sir, is much o' th' savour<br>
Of other your new pranks. I do beseech you <br>
To understand my purposes aright.<br>
As you are old and reverend, you should be wise.<br>
Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires;<br>
Men so disorder'd, so debosh'd, and bold<br>
That this our court, infected with their manners, <br>
Shows like a riotous inn. Epicurism and lust<br>
Make it more like a tavern or a brothel<br>
Than a grac'd palace. The shame itself doth speak<br>
For instant remedy. Be then desir'd<br>
By her that else will take the thing she begs <br>
A little to disquantity your train,<br>
And the remainder that shall still depend<br>
To be such men as may besort your age,<br>
Which know themselves, and you.
