          Nay, then I cannot blame his cousin king,<br>
That wished him on the barren mountains starve.<br>
But shall it be that you, that set the crown <br>
Upon the head of this forgetful man<br>
And for his sake wear the detested blot<br>
Of murderous subornation, shall it be,<br>
That you a world of curses undergo,<br>
Being the agents, or base second means,<br>
The cords, the ladder, or the hangman rather?<br>
O, pardon me that I descend so low,<br>
To show the line and the predicament<br>
Wherein you range under this subtle king;<br>
Shall it for shame be spoken in these days, <br>
Or fill up chronicles in time to come,<br>
That men of your nobility and power<br>
Did gage them both in an unjust behalf,<br>
As both of you.God pardon it!.have done,<br>
To put down Richard, that sweet lovely rose, <br>
An plant this thorn, this canker, Bolingbroke?<br>
And shall it in more shame be further spoken,<br>
That you are fool'd, discarded and shook off<br>
By him for whom these shames ye underwent?<br>
No; yet time serves wherein you may redeem <br>
Your banish'd honours and restore yourselves<br>
Into the good thoughts of the world again,<br>
Revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt<br>
Of this proud king, who studies day and night<br>
To answer all the debt he owes to you <br>
Even with the bloody payment of your deaths
