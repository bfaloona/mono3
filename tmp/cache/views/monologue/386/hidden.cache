          <b>Thersites.</b> Ajax goes up and down the field, asking for himself. <br>
<br>
<del><b>Achilles.</b> How so?</del> <br>
<br>
<b>Thersites.</b> He must fight singly to-morrow with Hector, and is so<br>
 prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he<br>
 raves in saying nothing. <br>
<br>
<del><b>Achilles.</b> How can that be? </del><br>
<br>
<b>Thersites.</b> Why, he stalks up and down like a peacock,â€”a stride<br>
 and a stand: ruminates like an hostess that hath no<br>
 arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning:<br>
 bites his lip with a politic regard, as who should<br>
 say 'There were wit in this head, an 'twould out;'<br>
 and so there is, but it lies as coldly in him as fire<br>
 in a flint, which will not show without knocking.<br>
 The man's undone forever; for if Hector break not his<br>
 neck i' the combat, he'll break 't himself in<br>
 vain-glory. He knows not me: I said 'Good morrow,<br>
 Ajax;' and he replies 'Thanks, Agamemnon.' What think <br>
 you of this man that takes me for the general? He's<br>
 grown a very land-fish, language-less, a monster.<br>
 A plague of opinion! a man may wear it on both<br>
 sides, like a leather jerkin.
