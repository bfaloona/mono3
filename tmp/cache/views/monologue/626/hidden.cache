          Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;<br>
I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.<br>
The evil that men do lives after them;<br>
The good is oft interred with their bones;<br>
So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus<br>
Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:<br>
If it were so, it was a grievous fault,<br>
And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.<br>
Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest— <br>
For Brutus is an honourable man;<br>
So are they all, all honourable men—<br>
Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.<br>
He was my friend, faithful and just to me:<br>
But Brutus says he was ambitious; <br>
And Brutus is an honourable man.<br>
He hath brought many captives home to Rome<br>
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:<br>
Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?<br>
When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept: <br>
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:<br>
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;<br>
And Brutus is an honourable man.<br>
You all did see that on the Lupercal<br>
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, <br>
Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?<br>
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;<br>
And, sure, he is an honourable man.<br>
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,<br>
But here I am to speak what I do know. <br>
You all did love him once, not without cause:<br>
What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?<br>
O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,<br>
And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;<br>
My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar, <br>
And I must pause till it come back to me.
