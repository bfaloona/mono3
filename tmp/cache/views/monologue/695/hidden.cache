          If there were reason for these miseries,<br>
Then into limits could I bind my woes:<br>
When heaven doth weep, doth not the earth o'erflow?<br>
If the winds rage, doth not the sea wax mad, <br>
Threatening the welkin with his big-swoln face?<br>
And wilt thou have a reason for this coil?<br>
I am the sea; hark, how her sighs do blow!<br>
She is the weeping welkin, I the earth:<br>
Then must my sea be moved with her sighs; <br>
Then must my earth with her continual tears<br>
Become a deluge, overflow'd and drown'd;<br>
For why my bowels cannot hide her woes,<br>
But like a drunkard must I vomit them.<br>
Then give me leave, for losers will have leave <br>
To ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues.
