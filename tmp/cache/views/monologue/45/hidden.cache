          O spite! O hell! I see you all are bent<br>
To set against me for your merriment:<br>
If you we re civil and knew courtesy,<br>
You would not do me thus much injury.<br>
Can you not hate me, as I know you do,<br>
But you must join in souls to mock me too?<br>
If you were men, as men you are in show,<br>
You would not use a gentle lady so;<br>
To vow, and swear, and superpraise my parts,<br>
When I am sure you hate me with your hearts.<br>
You both are rivals, and love Hermia;<br>
And now both rivals, to mock Helena:<br>
A trim exploit, a manly enterprise,<br>
To conjure tears up in a poor maid's eyes<br>
With your derision! none of noble sort<br>
Would so offend a virgin, and extort<br>
A poor soul's patience, all to make you sport.
