      <div class="monologue_preview">
          Under the cool shade of a sycamore<br>
I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour;<br>
When, lo! to interrupt my purposed rest, <br>
Toward that shade I might behold addrest<br>
The king and his companions: warily<br>
I stole into a neighbour thicket by,<br>
And overheard what you shall overhear,<br>
That, by and by, disguised they will be here.<br>
Their herald is a pretty knavish page,<br>
That well by heart hath conn'd his embassage:<br>
Action and accent did they teach him there;<br>
'Thus must thou speak,' and 'thus thy body bear:'<br>
And ever and anon they made a doubt <br>
Presence majestical would put him out,<br>
'For,' quoth the king, 'an angel shalt thou see;<br>
Yet fear not thou, but speak audaciously.'<br>
The boy replied, 'An angel is not evil;<br>
I should have fear'd her had she been a devil.' <br>
With that, all laugh'd and clapp'd him on the shoulder,<br>
Making the bold wag by their praises bolder:<br>
One rubb'd his elbow thus, and fleer'd and swore<br>
A better speech was never spoke before;<br>
Another, with his finger and his thumb, <br>
Cried, 'Via! we will do't, come what will come;'<br>
The third he caper'd, and cried, 'All goes well;'<br>
The fourth turn'd on the toe, and down he fell.<br>
With that, they all did tumble on the ground,<br>
With such a zealous laughter, so profound, <br>
That in this spleen ridiculous appears,<br>
To cheque their folly, passion's solemn tears.
