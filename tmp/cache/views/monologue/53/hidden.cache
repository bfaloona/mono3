      <div class="monologue_preview">
          That very time I saw, but thou couldst not,<br>
Flying between the cold moon and the earth,<br>
Cupid all arm'd: a certain aim he took<br>
At a fair vestal throned by the west, <br>
And loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow,<br>
As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts;<br>
But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft<br>
Quench'd in the chaste beams of the watery moon,<br>
And the imperial votaress passed on, <br>
In maiden meditation, fancy-free.<br>
Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell:<br>
It fell upon a little western flower,<br>
Before milk-white, now purple with love's wound,<br>
And maidens call it love-in-idleness. <br>
Fetch me that flower; the herb I shew'd thee once:<br>
The juice of it on sleeping eye-lids laid<br>
Will make or man or woman madly dote<br>
Upon the next live creature that it sees.<br>
Fetch me this herb; and be thou here again<br>
Ere the leviathan can swim a league.
