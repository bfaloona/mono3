          <b>Antony.</b> Unarm, Eros; the long day's task is done,<br>
      And we must sleep.<br>
      [To MARDIAN]<br>
      That thou depart'st hence safe,<br>
      Does pay thy labour richly; go.<br>
      [Exit MARDIAN]<br>
      Off, pluck off:<br>
      The seven-fold shield of Ajax cannot keep<br>
      The battery from my heart. O, cleave, my sides!<br>
      Heart, once be stronger than thy continent,<br>
      Crack thy frail case! Apace, Eros, apace.<br>
      No more a soldier: bruised pieces, go;<br>
      You have been nobly borne. From me awhile.<br>
      [Exit EROS]<br>
      I will o'ertake thee, Cleopatra, and<br>
      Weep for my pardon. So it must be, for now<br>
      All length is torture: since the torch is out,<br>
      Lie down, and stray no farther: now all labour<br>
      Mars what it does; yea, very force entangles<br>
      Itself with strength: seal then, and all is done.<br>
      Eros!.I come, my queen:.Eros!.Stay for me:<br>
      Where souls do couch on flowers, we'll hand in hand,<br>
      And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze:<br>
      Dido and her AEneas shall want troops,<br>
      And all the haunt be ours. Come, Eros, Eros!<br><br>

<del>[Re-enter EROS]<br><br>

<b>Eros.</b> What would my lord?</del> <br><br>

<b>Antony.</b> Since Cleopatra died,<br>
      I have lived in such dishonour, that the gods<br>
      Detest my baseness. I, that with my sword <br>
      Quarter'd the world, and o'er green Neptune's back<br>
      With ships made cities, condemn myself to lack<br>
      The courage of a woman; less noble mind<br>
      Than she which by her death our Caesar tells<br>
      'I am conqueror of myself.' Thou art sworn, Eros,<br>
      That, when the exigent should come, which now<br>
      Is come indeed, when I should see behind me<br>
      The inevitable prosecution of<br>
      Disgrace and horror, that, on my command,<br>
      Thou then wouldst kill me: do't; the time is come:<br>
      Thou strikest not me, 'tis Caesar thou defeat'st.<br>
      Put colour in thy cheek. <br><br>

<del><b>Eros.</b> The gods withhold me!<br>
      Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts,<br>
      Though enemy, lost aim, and could not? </del><br><br>

<b>Antony.</b> Eros,<br>
      Wouldst thou be window'd in great Rome and see<br>
      Thy master thus with pleach'd arms, bending down<br>
      His corrigible neck, his face subdued<br>
      To penetrative shame, whilst the wheel'd seat<br>
      Of fortunate Caesar, drawn before him, branded<br>
      His baseness that ensued? <br><br>

<del><b>Eros.</b> I would not see't.</del> <br><br>

<b>Antony.</b> Come, then; for with a wound I must be cured.<br>
      Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn <br>
      Most useful for thy country. <br><br>

<del><b>Eros.</b> O, sir, pardon me!</del> <br><br>

<b>Antony.</b> When I did make thee free, sworest thou not then<br>
      To do this when I bade thee? Do it at once;<br>
      Or thy precedent services are all<br>
      But accidents unpurposed. Draw, and come.<br><br> 

<del><b>Eros.</b> Turn from me, then, that noble countenance,<br>
      Wherein the worship of the whole world lies. </del><br><br>

<b>Antony.</b> Lo thee! <br><br>

[Turning from him]<br><br>

<del><b>Eros.</b> My sword is drawn. </del><br><br>

<b>Antony.</b> Then let it do at once<br>
      The thing why thou hast drawn it. <br><br>

<del><b>Eros.</b> My dear master,<br>
      My captain, and my emperor, let me say,<br>
      Before I strike this bloody stroke, farewell. </del><br><br>

<b>Antony.</b> 'Tis said, man; and farewell. <br><br>

<del><b>Eros.</b> Farewell, great chief. Shall I strike now? </del><br><br>

<b>Antony.</b> Now, Eros. <br><br>

<del><b>Eros.</b> Why, there then: thus I do escape the sorrow <br>
      Of Antony's death. </del><br><br>

[Kills himself]<br><br>

<b>Antony.</b> Thrice-nobler than myself!<br>
      Thou teachest me, O valiant Eros, what<br>
      I should, and thou couldst not. My queen and Eros<br>
      Have by their brave instruction got upon me<br>
      A nobleness in record: but I will be<br>
      A bridegroom in my death, and run into't<br>
      As to a lover's bed. Come, then; and, Eros,<br>
      Thy master dies thy scholar: to do thus<br>
      [Falling on his sword]<br>
      I learn'd of thee. How! not dead? not dead?<br>
      The guard, ho! O, dispatch me!
