      <div class="monologue_preview">
          Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment<br>
And state of bodies would bewray what life <br>
We have led since thy exile. Think with thyself<br>
How more unfortunate than all living women<br>
Are we come hither: since that thy sight, which should<br>
Make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance with comforts,<br>
Constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow;<br>
Making the mother, wife and child to see<br>
The son, the husband and the father tearing<br>
His country's bowels out. And to poor we <br>
Thine enmity's most capital: thou barr'st us<br>
Our prayers to the gods, which is a comfort<br>
That all but we enjoy; for how can we,<br>
Alas, how can we for our country pray.<br>
Whereto we are bound, together with thy victory, <br>
Whereto we are bound? alack, or we must lose<br>
The country, our dear nurse, or else thy person,<br>
Our comfort in the country. We must find<br>
An evident calamity, though we had<br>
Our wish, which side should win: for either thou <br>
Must, as a foreign recreant, be led<br>
With manacles thorough our streets, or else<br>
triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin,<br>
And bear the palm for having bravely shed<br>
Thy wife and children's blood. For myself, son, <br>
I purpose not to wait on fortune till<br>
These wars determine: if I cannot persuade thee<br>
Rather to show a noble grace to both parts<br>
Than seek the end of one, thou shalt no sooner<br>
March to assault thy country than to tread— <br>
Trust to't, thou shalt not—on thy mother's womb,<br>
That brought thee to this world.
