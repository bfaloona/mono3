          No more, you petty spirits of region low,<br>
      Offend our hearing; hush! How dare you ghosts<br>
      Accuse the thunderer, whose bolt, you know,<br>
      Sky-planted batters all rebelling coasts?<br>
      Poor shadows of Elysium, hence, and rest<br>
      Upon your never-withering banks of flowers:<br>
      Be not with mortal accidents opprest;<br>
      No care of yours it is; you know 'tis ours.<br>
      Whom best I love I cross; to make my gift,<br>
      The more delay'd, delighted. Be content;<br>
      Your low-laid son our godhead will uplift:<br>
      His comforts thrive, his trials well are spent.<br>
      Our Jovial star reign'd at his birth, and in <br>
      Our temple was he married. Rise, and fade.<br>
      He shall be lord of lady Imogen,<br>
      And happier much by his affliction made.<br>
      This tablet lay upon his breast, wherein<br>
      Our pleasure his full fortune doth confine: <br>
      and so, away: no further with your din<br>
      Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.<br>
      Mount, eagle, to my palace crystalline. <br>
