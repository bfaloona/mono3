          <b>Bottom.</b> Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams;<br>
      I thank thee, Moon, for shining now so bright; <br>
      For, by thy gracious, golden, glittering gleams,<br>
      I trust to take of truest Thisby sight.<br>
      But stay, O spite!<br>
      But mark, poor knight,<br>
     What dreadful dole is here!<br>
      Eyes, do you see?<br>
      How can it be?<br>
      O dainty duck! O dear!<br>
      Thy mantle good,<br>
      What, stain'd with blood!<br>
      Approach, ye Furies fell!<br>
      O Fates, come, come,<br>
      Cut thread and thrum;<br>
      Quail, crush, conclude, and quell! <br><br>

<del><b>Theseus.</b> This passion, and the death of a dear friend, would
      go near to make a man look sad. <br><br>

<b>Hippolyta.</b> Beshrew my heart, but I pity the man.</del><br><br> 

<b>Bottom.</b> O wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame?<br>
      Since lion vile hath here deflower'd my dear:<br>
      Which is--no, no--which was the fairest dame <br>
      That lived, that loved, that liked, that look'd
      with cheer.<br>
      Come, tears, confound;<br>
      Out, sword, and wound<br>
      The pap of Pyramus;<br>
      Ay, that left pap,<br>
      Where heart doth hop:<br>
      <i>[Stabs himself]</i><br>
      Thus die I, thus, thus, thus.<br>
      Now am I dead, <br>
      Now am I fled;<br>
      My soul is in the sky:<br>
      Tongue, lose thy light;<br>
      Moon take thy flight:<br>
      <i>[Exit Moonshine]</i><br>
      Now die, die, die, die, die.
