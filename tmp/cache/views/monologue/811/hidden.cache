      <div class="monologue_preview">
          Is Brutus sick? and is it physical<br>
To walk unbraced and suck up the humours<br>
Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick, <br>
And will he steal out of his wholesome bed,<br>
To dare the vile contagion of the night<br>
And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air<br>
To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus;<br>
You have some sick offence within your mind,<br>
Which, by the right and virtue of my place,<br>
I ought to know of: and, upon my knees,<br>
I charm you, by my once-commended beauty,<br>
By all your vows of love and that great vow<br>
Which did incorporate and make us one, <br>
That you unfold to me, yourself, your half,<br>
Why you are heavy, and what men to-night<br>
Have had to resort to you: for here have been<br>
Some six or seven, who did hide their faces<br>
Even from darkness.
