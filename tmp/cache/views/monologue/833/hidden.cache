           Have I not reason, think you, to look pale?<br>
These two have 'ticed me hither to this place:<br>
A barren detested vale, you see it is;<br>
The trees, though summer, yet forlorn and lean, <br>
O'ercome with moss and baleful mistletoe:<br>
Here never shines the sun; here nothing breeds,<br>
Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven:<br>
And when they show'd me this abhorred pit,<br>
They told me, here, at dead time of the night, <br>
A thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes,<br>
Ten thousand swelling toads, as many urchins,<br>
Would make such fearful and confused cries<br>
As any mortal body hearing it<br>
Should straight fall mad, or else die suddenly.<br>
No sooner had they told this hellish tale,<br>
But straight they told me they would bind me here<br>
Unto the body of a dismal yew,<br>
And leave me to this miserable death:<br>
And then they call'd me foul adulteress, <br>
Lascivious Goth, and all the bitterest terms<br>
That ever ear did hear to such effect:<br>
And, had you not by wondrous fortune come,<br>
This vengeance on me had they executed.<br>
Revenge it, as you love your mother's life, <br>
Or be ye not henceforth call'd my children.
