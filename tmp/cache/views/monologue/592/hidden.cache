      <div class="monologue_preview">
          All tongues speak of him, and the bleared sights<br>
Are spectacled to see him: your prattling nurse<br>
Into a rapture lets her baby cry<br>
While she chats him: the kitchen malkin pins<br>
Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,<br>
Clambering the walls to eye him: stalls, bulks, windows,<br>
Are smother'd up, leads fill'd, and ridges horsed<br>
With variable complexions, all agreeing <br>
In earnestness to see him: seld-shown flamens<br>
Do press among the popular throngs and puff<br>
To win a vulgar station: or veil'd dames<br>
Commit the war of white and damask in<br>
Their nicely-gawded cheeks to the wanton spoil <br>
Of Phoebus' burning kisses: such a pother<br>
As if that whatsoever god who leads him<br>
Were slily crept into his human powers<br>
And gave him graceful posture.
