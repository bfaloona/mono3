          <b>Lear.</b> Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow!<br>
 You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout<br>
 Till you have drench'd our steeples, drown'd the cocks! <br>
 You sulph'rous and thought-executing fires,<br>
 Vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts,<br>
 Singe my white head! And thou, all-shaking thunder,<br>
 Strike flat the thick rotundity o' th' world,<br>
 Crack Nature's moulds, all germains spill at once, <br>
 That makes ingrateful man! <br>
<br>
<del><b>Fool.</b> O nuncle, court holy water in a dry house is better than this<br>
 rain water out o' door. Good nuncle, in, and ask thy daughters<br>
 blessing! Here's a night pities nether wise men nor fools. </del><br>
<br>
<b>Lear.</b> Rumble thy bellyful! Spit, fire! spout, rain!<br>
 Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire are my daughters.<br>
 I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness.<br>
 I never gave you kingdom, call'd you children,<br>
 You owe me no subscription. Then let fall<br>
 Your horrible pleasure. Here I stand your slave, <br>
 A poor, infirm, weak, and despis'd old man.<br>
 But yet I call you servile ministers,<br>
 That will with two pernicious daughters join<br>
 Your high-engender'd battles 'gainst a head<br>
 So old and white as this! O! O! 'tis foul!
