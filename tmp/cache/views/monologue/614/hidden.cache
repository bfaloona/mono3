          Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world<br>
Like a Colossus, and we petty men<br>
Walk under his huge legs and peep about<br>
To find ourselves dishonourable graves.<br>
Men at some time are masters of their fates:<br>
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,<br>
But in ourselves, that we are underlings.<br>
Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that 'Caesar'?<br>
Why should that name be sounded more than yours?<br>
Write them together, yours is as fair a name; <br>
Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;<br>
Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with 'em,<br>
Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar.<br>
Now, in the names of all the gods at once,<br>
Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed, <br>
That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!<br>
Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!<br>
When went there by an age, since the great flood,<br>
But it was famed with more than with one man?<br>
When could they say till now, that talk'd of Rome,<br>
That her wide walls encompass'd but one man?<br>
Now is it Rome indeed and room enough,<br>
When there is in it but one only man.<br>
O, you and I have heard our fathers say,<br>
There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd <br>
The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome<br>
As easily as a king.
