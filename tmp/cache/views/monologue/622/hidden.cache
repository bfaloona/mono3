          O mighty Caesar! dost thou lie so low?<br>
Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils, <br>
Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.<br>
I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,<br>
Who else must be let blood, who else is rank:<br>
If I myself, there is no hour so fit<br>
As Caesar's death hour, nor no instrument<br>
Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich<br>
With the most noble blood of all this world.<br>
I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,<br>
Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,<br>
Fulfil your pleasure. Live a thousand years, <br>
I shall not find myself so apt to die:<br>
No place will please me so, no mean of death,<br>
As here by Caesar, and by you cut off,<br>
The choice and master spirits of this age.
