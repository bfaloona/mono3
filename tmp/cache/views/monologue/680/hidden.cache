          Thou art a slave, whom Fortune's tender arm <br>
With favour never clasp'd; but bred a dog.<br>
Hadst thou, like us from our first swath, proceeded<br>
The sweet degrees that this brief world affords<br>
To such as may the passive drugs of it<br>
Freely command, thou wouldst have plunged thyself <br>
In general riot; melted down thy youth<br>
In different beds of lust; and never learn'd<br>
The icy precepts of respect, but follow'd<br>
The sugar'd game before thee. But myself,<br>
Who had the world as my confectionary, <br>
The mouths, the tongues, the eyes and hearts of men<br>
At duty, more than I could frame employment,<br>
That numberless upon me stuck as leaves<br>
Do on the oak, hive with one winter's brush<br>
Fell from their boughs and left me open, bare <br>
For every storm that blows: I, to bear this,<br>
That never knew but better, is some burden:<br>
Thy nature did commence in sufferance, time<br>
Hath made thee hard in't. Why shouldst thou hate men?<br>
They never flatter'd thee: what hast thou given? <br>
If thou wilt curse, thy father, that poor rag,<br>
Must be thy subject, who in spite put stuff<br>
To some she beggar and compounded thee<br>
Poor rogue hereditary. Hence, be gone!<br>
If thou hadst not been born the worst of men, <br>
Thou hadst been a knave and flatterer.
