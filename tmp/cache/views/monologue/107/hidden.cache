          Have patience, sir; O! let it not be so;<br>
Herein you war against your reputation, <br>
And draw within the compass of suspect <br>
The unviolated honour of your wife. <br>
Once this,'your long experience of her wisdom,<br>
Her sober virtue, years, and modesty, <br>
Plead on her part some cause to you unknown;<br>
And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse <br>
Why at this time the doors are made against you. <br>
Be rul'd by me: depart in patience,  <br>
And let us to the Tiger all to dinner; <br>
And about evening come yourself alone, <br>
To know the reason of this strange restraint. <br>
If by strong hand you offer to break in <br>
Now in the stirring passage of the day,	 <br>
A vulgar comment will be made of it,<br>
And that supposed by the common rout  <br>
Against your yet ungalled estimation,  <br>
That may with foul intrusion enter in   <br>
And dwell upon your grave when you are dead;<br>
For slander lives upon succession,  <br>
For ever housed where it gets possession.
