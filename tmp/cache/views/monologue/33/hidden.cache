          How happy some o'er other some can be!<br>
Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.<br>
But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;<br>
He will not know what all but he do know: <br>
And as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes,<br>
So I, admiring of his qualities:<br>
Things base and vile, folding no quantity,<br>
Love can transpose to form and dignity:<br>
Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;<br>
And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind:<br>
Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste;<br>
Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:<br>
And therefore is Love said to be a child,<br>
Because in choice he is so oft beguiled. <br>
As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,<br>
So the boy Love is perjured every where:<br>
For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne,<br>
He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine;<br>
And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt, <br>
So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt.<br>
I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight:<br>
Then to the wood will he to-morrow night<br>
Pursue her; and for this intelligence<br>
If I have thanks, it is a dear expense: <br>
But herein mean I to enrich my pain,<br>
To have his sight thither and back again.
