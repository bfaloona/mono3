          <b>Ophelia.</b> <i>[sings]</i><br>
      They bore him barefac'd on the bier<br>
      (Hey non nony, nony, hey nony)<br>
      And in his grave rain'd many a tear. <br>
      Fare you well, my dove! <br><br>

<del><b>Laertes.</b> Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
      It could not move thus. </del><br><br>

<b>Ophelia.</b> You must sing 'A-down a-down, and you call him a-down-a.' O,
      how the wheel becomes it! It is the false steward, that stole his
      master's daughter. <br><br>

<del><b>Laertes.</b> This nothing's more than matter. </del><br><br>

<b>Ophelia.</b> There's rosemary, that's for remembrance. Pray you, love,
      remember. And there is pansies, that's for thoughts. <br><br>

<del><b>Laertes.</b> A document in madness! Thoughts and remembrance fitted.</del><br><br>

<b> Ophelia.</b> There's fennel for you, and columbines. There's rue for you,
      and here's some for me. We may call it herb of grace o' Sundays.
      O, you must wear your rue with a difference! There's a daisy. I
      would give you some violets, but they wither'd all when my father
      died. They say he made a good end. 
      <i>[sings]</i> For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy. <br><br>

<del><b>Laertes.</b> Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
      She turns to favour and to prettiness.</del> <br><br>

<b>Ophelia.</b> <i>[sings]</i><br>
      And will he not come again? <br>
      And will he not come again?<br>
      No, no, he is dead;<br>
      Go to thy deathbed;<br>
      He never will come again.<br>
      His beard was as white as snow,<br>
      All flaxen was his poll.<br>
      He is gone, he is gone,<br>
      And we cast away moan.<br>
      God 'a'mercy on his soul!<br>
      And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God b' wi' you.<br>
