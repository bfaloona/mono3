          <div align=right>All is lost;</div>
This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me:<br>
My fleet hath yielded to the foe; and yonder<br>
They cast their caps up and carouse together<br>
Like friends long lost. Triple-turn'd whore! 'tis thou<br>
Hast sold me to this novice; and my heart<br>
Makes only wars on thee. Bid them all fly;<br>
For when I am revenged upon my charm,<br>
I have done all. Bid them all fly; begone.<br>
[Exit SCARUS]<br>
O sun, thy uprise shall I see no more:<br>
Fortune and Antony part here; even here<br>
Do we shake hands. All come to this? The hearts<br>
That spaniel'd me at heels, to whom I gave<br>
Their wishes, do discandy, melt their sweets<br>
On blossoming Caesar; and this pine is bark'd,<br>
That overtopp'd them all. Betray'd I am:<br>
O this false soul of Egypt! this grave charm,.<br>
Whose eye beck'd forth my wars, and call'd them home;<br>
Whose bosom was my crownet, my chief end,.<br>
Like a right gipsy, hath, at fast and loose,<br>
Beguiled me to the very heart of loss.<br>
What, Eros, Eros!
