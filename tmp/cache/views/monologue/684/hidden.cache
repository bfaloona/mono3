So true, so just, and now so comfortable?<br>
It almost turns my dangerous nature mild.<br>
Let me behold thy face. Surely, this man <br>
Was born of woman.<br>
Forgive my general and exceptless rashness,<br>
You perpetual-sober gods! I do proclaim<br>
One honest manâ€”mistake me notâ€”but one;<br>
No more, I pray,â€”and he's a steward. <br>
How fain would I have hated all mankind!<br>
And thou redeem'st thyself: but all, save thee,<br>
I fell with curses.<br>
Methinks thou art more honest now than wise;<br>
For, by oppressing and betraying me, <br>
Thou mightst have sooner got another service:<br>
For many so arrive at second masters,<br>
Upon their first lord's neck. But tell me trueâ€”<br>
For I must ever doubt, though ne'er so sureâ€”<br>
Is not thy kindness subtle, covetous,<br>
If not a usuring kindness, and, as rich men deal gifts,<br>
Expecting in return twenty for one?
