          To be thus is nothing;<br>
But to be safely thus.--Our fears in Banquo<br>
Stick deep; and in his royalty of nature<br>
Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares;<br>
And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,<br>
He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour<br>
To act in safety. There is none but he<br>
Whose being I do fear: and, under him,<br>
My Genius is rebuked; as, it is said, <br>
Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters<br>
When first they put the name of king upon me,<br>
And bade them speak to him: then prophet-like<br>
They hail'd him father to a line of kings:<br>
Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,<br>
And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,<br>
Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,<br>
No son of mine succeeding. If 't be so,<br>
For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind;<br>
For them the gracious Duncan have I murder'd;<br>
Put rancours in the vessel of my peace<br>
Only for them; and mine eternal jewel<br>
Given to the common enemy of man,<br>
To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!<br>
Rather than so, come fate into the list. <br>
And champion me to the utterance!
