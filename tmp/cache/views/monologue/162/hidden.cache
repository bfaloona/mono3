          My wind cooling my broth<br>
Would blow me to an ague, when I thought<br>
What harm a wind too great at sea might do.<br>
I should not see the sandy hour-glass run,<br>
But I should think of shallows and of flats,<br>
And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand,<br>
Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs <br>
To kiss her burial. Should I go to church<br>
And see the holy edifice of stone,<br>
And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,<br>
Which touching but my gentle vessel's side,<br>
Would scatter all her spices on the stream,<br>
Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,<br>
And, in a word, but even now worth this,<br>
And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought<br>
To think on this, and shall I lack the thought<br>
That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?<br>
But tell not me; I know, Antonio<br>
Is sad to think upon his merchandise.<br>
