          In Antiochus and his daughter you have heard<br>
Of monstrous lust the due and just reward:<br>
In Pericles, his queen and daughter, seen,<br>
Although assail'd with fortune fierce and keen, <br>
Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,<br>
Led on by heaven, and crown'd with joy at last:<br>
In Helicanus may you well descry<br>
A figure of truth, of faith, of loyalty:<br>
In reverend Cerimon there well appears <br>
The worth that learned charity aye wears:<br>
For wicked Cleon and his wife, when fame<br>
Had spread their cursed deed, and honour'd name<br>
Of Pericles, to rage the city turn,<br>
That him and his they in his palace burn; <br>
The gods for murder seemed so content<br>
To punish them; although not done, but meant.<br>
So, on your patience evermore attending,<br>
New joy wait on you! Here our play has ending.
