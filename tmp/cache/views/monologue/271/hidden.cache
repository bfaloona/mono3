          In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.<br>
Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris! <br>
What said my man, when my betossed soul<br>
Did not attend him as we rode? I think<br>
He told me Paris should have married Juliet:<br>
Said he not so? or did I dream it so?<br>
Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet, <br>
To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,<br>
One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!<br>
I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;<br>
A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,<br>
For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes<br>
This vault a feasting presence full of light.<br>
Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.<br>
<i>[Laying PARIS in the tomb]</i><br>
How oft when men are at the point of death<br>
Have they been merry! which their keepers call<br>
A lightning before death: O, how may I<br>
Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!<br>
Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,<br>
Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:<br>
Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet<br>
Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,<br>
And death's pale flag is not advanced there.<br>
Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?<br>
O, what more favour can I do to thee,<br>
Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain <br>
To sunder his that was thine enemy?<br>
Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,<br>
Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe<br>
That unsubstantial death is amorous,<br>
And that the lean abhorred monster keeps <br>
Thee here in dark to be his paramour?<br>
For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;<br>
And never from this palace of dim night<br>
Depart again: here, here will I remain<br>
With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here <br>
Will I set up my everlasting rest,<br>
And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars<br>
From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!<br>
Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you<br>
The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss <br>
A dateless bargain to engrossing death!<br>
Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!<br>
Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on<br>
The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!<br>
Here's to my love!<br>
<i>[Drinks]</i><br>
O true apothecary!<br>
Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.<br>
<i>[Dies]</i>
