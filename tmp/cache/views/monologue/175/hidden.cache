          I have possess'd your grace of what I purpose;<br>
And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn<br>
To have the due and forfeit of my bond:<br>
If you deny it, let the danger light<br>
Upon your charter and your city's freedom.<br>
You'll ask me, why I rather choose to have<br>
A weight of carrion flesh than to receive<br>
Three thousand ducats: I'll not answer that:<br>
But, say, it is my humour: is it answer'd?<br>
What if my house be troubled with a rat<br>
And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats<br>
To have it baned? What, are you answer'd yet?<br>
Some men there are love not a gaping pig;<br>
Some, that are mad if they behold a cat;<br>
And others, when the bagpipe sings i' the nose,<br>
Cannot contain their urine: for affection,<br>
Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood<br>
Of what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer:<br>
As there is no firm reason to be render'd,<br>
Why he cannot abide a gaping pig;<br>
Why he, a harmless necessary cat;<br>
Why he, a woollen bagpipe; but of force<br>
Must yield to such inevitable shame<br>
As to offend, himself being offended;<br>
So can I give no reason, nor I will not,<br>
More than a lodged hate and a certain loathing<br>
I bear Antonio, that I follow thus<br>
A losing suit against him. Are you answer'd?
