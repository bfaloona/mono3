          I would not be thy executioner:<br>	 
I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.<br>
Thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye:<br> 
'Tis pretty, sure, and very probable, <br>
That eyes, that are the frail.st and softest things,<br> 
Who shut their coward gates on atomies, <br>
Should be call'd tyrants, butchers, murderers!<br> 
Now I do frown on thee with all my heart; <br>
And, if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee;<br> 
Now counterfeit to swound; why now fall down; <br>
Or, if thou canst not, O! for shame, for shame, <br>
Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers.  <br>
Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee;<br> 
Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains <br>
Some scar of it; lean but upon a rush,  <br>
The cicatrice and capable impressure <br>
Thy palm some moment keeps; but now mine eyes,<br> 
Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not,<br>
Nor, I am sure, there is no force in eyes <br>
That can do hurt.<br>
