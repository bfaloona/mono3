           I take to-day a wife, and my election<br>
Is led on in the conduct of my will; <br>
My will enkindled by mine eyes and ears,<br>
Two traded pilots 'twixt the dangerous shores<br>
Of will and judgment: how may I avoid,<br>
Although my will distaste what it elected,<br>
The wife I chose? there can be no evasion <br>
To blench from this and to stand firm by honour:<br>
We turn not back the silks upon the merchant,<br>
When we have soil'd them, nor the remainder viands<br>
We do not throw in unrespective sieve,<br>
Because we now are full. It was thought meet <br>
Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks:<br>
Your breath of full consent bellied his sails;<br>
The seas and winds, old wranglers, took a truce<br>
And did him service: he touch'd the ports desired,<br>
And for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive, <br>
He brought a Grecian queen, whose youth and freshness<br>
Wrinkles Apollo's, and makes stale the morning.<br>
Why keep we her? the Grecians keep our aunt:<br>
Is she worth keeping? why, she is a pearl,<br>
Whose price hath launch'd above a thousand ships, <br>
And turn'd crown'd kings to merchants.<br>
If you'll avouch 'twas wisdom Paris went—<br>
As you must needs, for you all cried 'Go, go,'—<br>
If you'll confess he brought home noble prize—<br>
As you must needs, for you all clapp'd your hands <br>
And cried 'Inestimable!'—why do you now<br>
The issue of your proper wisdoms rate,<br>
And do a deed that fortune never did,<br>
Beggar the estimation which you prized<br>
Richer than sea and land? O, theft most base, <br>
That we have stol'n what we do fear to keep!<br>
But, thieves, unworthy of a thing so stol'n,<br>
That in their country did them that disgrace,<br>
We fear to warrant in our native place!
