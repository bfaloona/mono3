      <div class="monologue_preview">
          [Jaq.]  A fool, a fool! I met a fool i' the forest,<br>	 
A motley fool; a miserable world!  <br>
As I do live by food, I met a fool;<br> 
Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun,<br> 
And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms, <br>
In good set terms, and yet a motley fool.  <br>
'Good morrow, fool,' quoth I. 'No, sir,' quoth he, <br>
'Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune.' <br>
And then he drew a dial from his poke, <br>
And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye, <br>
Says very wisely, 'It is ten o'clock; <br>
Thus may we see,' quoth he, 'how the world wags:<br> 
'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine, <br>
And after one hour more 'twill be eleven; <br>
And so, from hour to hour we ripe and ripe, <br>
And then from hour to hour we rot and rot, <br>
And thereby hangs a tale.' When I did hear  <br>
The motley fool thus moral on the time, <br>
My lungs began to crow like chanticleer,  <br>
That fools should be so deep-contemplative, <br>
And I did laugh sans intermission <br>
An hour by his dial. O noble fool! 
A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.<br> 
 <font size='-1' style='text-decoration: line-through;'>
[Duke S.]  What fool is this? <br></font>
[Jaq.]  O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,<br> 
And says, if ladies be but young and fair,<br>
They have the gift to know it; and in his brain,.<br> 
Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit <br>
After a voyage,'he hath strange places crammed'd<br> 
With observation, the which he vents <br>
In mangled forms. O that I were a fool! <br>
I am ambitious for a motley coat.  <br>
<font size='-1' style='text-decoration: line-through;'>
[Duke S.]  Thou shalt have one. </font><br>
[Jaq.]        It is my only suit; <br>
Provided that you weed your better judgments<br> 
Of all opinion that grows rank in them <br>
That I am wise. I must have liberty <br>
Withal, as large a charter as the wind, <br>
To blow on whom I please; for so fools have:<br> 
And they that are most galled with my folly,  <br>
They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so? <br>
The 'why' is plain as way to parish church: <br>
He that a fool doth very wisely hit  <br>
Doth very foolishly, although he smart, <br>
Not to seem senseless of the bob; if not, <br>
The wise man's folly is anatomiz'd  <br>
Even by the squandering glances of the fool.<br> 
Invest me in my motley; give me leave <br>
To speak my mind, and I will through and through<br> 
Cleanse the foul body of th' infected world, <br>
If they will patiently receive my medicine.<br>
