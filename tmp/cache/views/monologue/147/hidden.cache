          Now step I forth to whip hypocrisy.<br>
<i>[Advancing]</i><br>
Ah, good my liege, I pray thee, pardon me!<br>
Good heart, what grace hast thou, thus to reprove<br>
These worms for loving, that art most in love? <br>
Your eyes do make no coaches; in your tears<br>
There is no certain princess that appears;<br>
You'll not be perjured, 'tis a hateful thing;<br>
Tush, none but minstrels like of sonneting!<br>
But are you not ashamed? nay, are you not, <br>
All three of you, to be thus much o'ershot?<br>
You found his mote; the king your mote did see;<br>
But I a beam do find in each of three.<br>
O, what a scene of foolery have I seen,<br>
Of sighs, of groans, of sorrow and of teen! <br>
O me, with what strict patience have I sat,<br>
To see a king transformed to a gnat!<br>
To see great Hercules whipping a gig,<br>
And profound Solomon to tune a jig,<br>
And Nestor play at push-pin with the boys, <br>
And critic Timon laugh at idle toys!<br>
Where lies thy grief, O, tell me, good Dumain?<br>
And gentle Longaville, where lies thy pain?<br>
And where my liege's? all about the breast:<br>
A caudle, ho!
