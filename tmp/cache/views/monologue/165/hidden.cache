      <div class="monologue_preview">
          Signior Antonio, many a time and oft<br>
In the Rialto you have rated me<br>
About my moneys and my usances:<br>
Still have I borne it with a patient shrug,<br>
For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe.<br>
You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,<br>
And spit upon my Jewish gaberdine,<br>
And all for use of that which is mine own.<br>
Well then, it now appears you need my help:<br>
Go to, then; you come to me, and you say<br>
'Shylock, we would have moneys:' you say so;<br>
You, that did void your rheum upon my beard<br>
And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur <br>
Over your threshold: moneys is your suit<br>
What should I say to you? Should I not say<br>
'Hath a dog money? is it possible<br>
A cur can lend three thousand ducats?' Or<br>
Shall I bend low and in a bondman's key,<br>
With bated breath and whispering humbleness, Say this;<br>
'Fair sir, you spit on me on Wednesday last;<br>
You spurn'd me such a day; another time<br>
You call'd me dog; and for these courtesies<br>
I'll lend you thus much moneys'? <br>
      </div>
