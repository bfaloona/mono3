          The more thou damm'st it up, the more it burns.<br>
The current that with gentle murmur glides,<br>
Thou know'st, being stopp'd, impatiently doth rage;<br>
But when his fair course is not hindered,<br>
He makes sweet music with the enamell'ed stones,<br>
Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge<br>
He overtaketh in his pilgrimage, <br>
And so by many winding nooks he strays<br>
With willing sport to the wild ocean.<br>
Then let me go and hinder not my course<br>
I'll be as patient as a gentle stream<br>
And make a pastime of each weary step, <br>
Till the last step have brought me to my love;<br>
And there I'll rest, as after much turmoil<br>
A blessed soul doth in Elysium.
