          What, am I poor of late?<br>
'Tis certain, greatness, once fall'n out with fortune,<br>
Must fall out with men too: what the declined is<br>
He shall as soon read in the eyes of others<br>
As feel in his own fall; for men, like butterflies, <br>
Show not their mealy wings but to the summer,<br>
And not a man, for being simply man,<br>
Hath any honour, but honour for those honours<br>
That are without him, as place, riches, favour,<br>
Prizes of accident as oft as merit: <br>
Which when they fall, as being slippery standers,<br>
The love that lean'd on them as slippery too,<br>
Do one pluck down another and together<br>
Die in the fall. But 'tis not so with me:<br>
Fortune and I are friends: I do enjoy <br>
At ample point all that I did possess,<br>
Save these men's looks; who do, methinks, find out<br>
Something not worth in me such rich beholding<br>
As they have often given. Here is Ulysses;<br>
I'll interrupt his reading. <br>
How now Ulysses!
