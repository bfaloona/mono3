          But see what heaven can do! By this our change,<br>
These mouths, who but of late, earth, sea, and air,<br>
Were all too little to content and please,<br>
Although they gave their creatures in abundance,<br>
As houses are defiled for want of use,<br>
They are now starved for want of exercise:<br>
Those palates who, not yet two summers younger, <br>
Must have inventions to delight the taste,<br>
Would now be glad of bread, and beg for it:<br>
Those mothers who, to nousle up their babes,<br>
Thought nought too curious, are ready now<br>
To eat those little darlings whom they loved. <br>
So sharp are hunger's teeth, that man and wife<br>
Draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life:<br>
Here stands a lord, and there a lady weeping;<br>
Here many sink, yet those which see them fall<br>
Have scarce strength left to give them burial.<br>
Is not this true?
