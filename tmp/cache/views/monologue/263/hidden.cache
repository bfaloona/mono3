          <i>[Give this line of Benvolio's to Mercutio for the purposes of this monologue]</i>: <b>Benvolio.</b> Why, what is Tybalt? <br> <br>

<b>Mercutio.</b> More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is
      the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as
      you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and
      proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and 
      the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk
      button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the
      very first house, of the first and second cause:
      ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the
      hai! <br><br>

<del><b>Benvolio.</b> The what? </del><br><br>

<b>Mercutio.</b> The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting
      fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,
      a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good
      whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing, 
      grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with
      these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these
      perdona-mi's, who stand so much on the new form,
      that they cannot at ease on the old bench? O, their
      bones, their bones!
