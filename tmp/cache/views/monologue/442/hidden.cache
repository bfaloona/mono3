      <div class="monologue_preview">
           The mercy that was quick in us but late, <br>
By your own counsel is suppress'd and kill'd:<br>
You must not dare, for shame, to talk of mercy;<br>
For your own reasons turn into your bosoms,<br>
As dogs upon their masters, worrying you.<br>
See you, my princes, and my noble peers, <br>
These English monsters! My Lord of Cambridge here,<br>
You know how apt our love was to accord<br>
To furnish him with all appertinents<br>
Belonging to his honour; and this man<br>
Hath, for a few light crowns, lightly conspired, <br>
And sworn unto the practises of France,<br>
To kill us here in Hampton: to the which<br>
This knight, no less for bounty bound to us<br>
Than Cambridge is, hath likewise sworn. But, O,<br>
What shall I say to thee, Lord Scroop? thou cruel,<br>
Ingrateful, savage and inhuman creature!<br>
Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels,<br>
That knew'st the very bottom of my soul,<br>
That almost mightst have coin'd me into gold,<br>
Wouldst thou have practised on me for thy use, <br>
May it be possible, that foreign hire<br>
Could out of thee extract one spark of evil<br>
That might annoy my finger? 'tis so strange,<br>
That, though the truth of it stands off as gross<br>
As black and white, my eye will scarcely see it.<br>
Treason and murder ever kept together,<br>
As two yoke-devils sworn to either's purpose,<br>
Working so grossly in a natural cause,<br>
That admiration did not whoop at them:<br>
But thou, 'gainst all proportion, didst bring in <br>
Wonder to wait on treason and on murder:<br>
And whatsoever cunning fiend it was<br>
That wrought upon thee so preposterously<br>
Hath got the voice in hell for excellence:<br>
All other devils that suggest by treasons <br>
Do botch and bungle up damnation<br>
With patches, colours, and with forms being fetch'd<br>
From glistering semblances of piety;<br>
But he that temper'd thee bade thee stand up,<br>
Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason, <br>
Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor.<br>
If that same demon that hath gull'd thee thus<br>
Should with his lion gait walk the whole world,<br>
He might return to vasty Tartar back,<br>
And tell the legions 'I can never win <br>
A soul so easy as that Englishman's.'<br>
O, how hast thou with 'jealousy infected<br>
The sweetness of affiance! Show men dutiful?<br>
Why, so didst thou: seem they grave and learned?<br>
Why, so didst thou: come they of noble family? <br>
Why, so didst thou: seem they religious?<br>
Why, so didst thou: or are they spare in diet,<br>
Free from gross passion or of mirth or anger,<br>
Constant in spirit, not swerving with the blood,<br>
Garnish'd and deck'd in modest complement, <br>
Not working with the eye without the ear,<br>
And but in purged judgment trusting neither?<br>
Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem:<br>
And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot,<br>
To mark the full-fraught man and best indued<br>
With some suspicion. I will weep for thee;<br>
For this revolt of thine, methinks, is like<br>
Another fall of man. Their faults are open:<br>
Arrest them to the answer of the law;<br>
And God acquit them of their practises!
