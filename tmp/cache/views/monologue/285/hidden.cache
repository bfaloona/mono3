          So sure as you your father's. I, old Morgan,<br>
Am that Belarius whom you sometime banish'd:<br>
Your pleasure was my mere offence, my punishment<br>
Itself, and all my treason; that I suffer'd<br>
Was all the harm I did. These gentle princes— <br>
For such and so they are—these twenty years<br>
Have I train'd up: those arts they have as I<br>
Could put into them; my breeding was, sir, as<br>
Your highness knows. Their nurse, Euriphile,<br>
Whom for the theft I wedded, stole these children <br>
Upon my banishment: I moved her to't,<br>
Having received the punishment before,<br>
For that which I did then: beaten for loyalty<br>
Excited me to treason: their dear loss,<br>
The more of you 'twas felt, the more it shaped <br>
Unto my end of stealing them. But, gracious sir,<br>
Here are your sons again; and I must lose<br>
Two of the sweet'st companions in the world.<br>
The benediction of these covering heavens<br>
Fall on their heads like dew! for they are worthy <br>
To inlay heaven with stars.
