          I am sorry I should force you to believe<br>
That which I would to God I had not seen;<br>
But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state, <br>
Rend'ring faint quittance, wearied and out-breath'd,<br>
To Harry Monmouth, whose swift wrath beat down<br>
The never-daunted Percy to the earth,<br>
From whence with life he never more sprung up.<br>
In few, his death—whose spirit lent a fire <br>
Even to the dullest peasant in his camp—<br>
Being bruited once, took fire and heat away<br>
From the best-temper'd courage in his troops;<br>
For from his metal was his party steeled;<br>
Which once in him abated, all the rest <br>
Turn'd on themselves, like dull and heavy lead.<br>
And as the thing that's heavy in itself<br>
Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed,<br>
So did our men, heavy in Hotspur's loss,<br>
Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear <br>
That arrows fled not swifter toward their aim<br>
Than did our soldiers, aiming at their safety,<br>
Fly from the field. Then was that noble Worcester<br>
Too soon ta'en prisoner; and that furious Scot,<br>
The bloody Douglas, whose well-labouring sword <br>
Had three times slain th' appearance of the King,<br>
Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame<br>
Of those that turn'd their backs, and in his flight,<br>
Stumbling in fear, was took. The sum of all<br>
Is that the King hath won, and hath sent out <br>
A speedy power to encounter you, my lord,<br>
Under the conduct of young Lancaster<br>
And Westmoreland. This is the news at full.
