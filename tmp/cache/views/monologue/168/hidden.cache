      <div class="monologue_preview">
          Some god direct my judgment! Let me see;<br>
I will survey the inscriptions back again.<br>
What says this leaden casket?<br>
'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'<br>
Must give: for what? for lead? hazard for lead?<br>
This casket threatens. Men that hazard all<br>
Do it in hope of fair advantages: <br>
A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross;<br>
I'll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.<br>
What says the silver with her virgin hue?<br>
'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'<br>
As much as he deserves! Pause there, Morocco, <br>
And weigh thy value with an even hand:<br>
If thou be'st rated by thy estimation,<br>
Thou dost deserve enough; and yet enough<br>
May not extend so far as to the lady:<br>
And yet to be afeard of my deserving<br>
Were but a weak disabling of myself.<br>
As much as I deserve! Why, that's the lady:<br>
I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes,<br>
In graces and in qualities of breeding;<br>
But more than these, in love I do deserve.<br>
What if I stray'd no further, but chose here?<br>
Let's see once more this saying graved in gold<br>
'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'<br>
Why, that's the lady; all the world desires her;<br>
From the four corners of the earth they come,<br>
To kiss this shrine, this mortal-breathing saint:<br>
The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds<br>
Of wide Arabia are as thoroughfares now<br>
For princes to come view fair Portia:<br>
The watery kingdom, whose ambitious head<br>
Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar<br>
To stop the foreign spirits, but they come,<br>
As o'er a brook, to see fair Portia.<br>
One of these three contains her heavenly picture.<br>
Is't like that lead contains her? 'Twere damnation<br>
To think so base a thought: it were too gross<br>
To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.<br>
Or shall I think in silver she's immured,<br>
Being ten times undervalued to tried gold?<br>
O sinful thought! Never so rich a gem<br>
Was set in worse than gold. They have in England<br>
A coin that bears the figure of an angel<br>
Stamped in gold, but that's insculp'd upon;<br>
But here an angel in a golden bed<br>
Lies all within. Deliver me the key: <br>
Here do I choose, and thrive I as I may!
