          And I, forsooth, in love! I, that have been love's whip;<br>
A very beadle to a humorous sigh;<br>
A critic, nay, a night-watch constable;<br>
A domineering pedant o'er the boy; <br>
Than whom no mortal so magnificent!<br>
This whimpled, whining, purblind, wayward boy;<br>
This senior-junior, giant-dwarf, Dan Cupid;<br>
Regent of love-rhymes, lord of folded arms,<br>
The anointed sovereign of sighs and groans,<br>
Liege of all loiterers and malcontents,<br>
Dread prince of plackets, king of codpieces,<br>
Sole imperator and great general<br>
Of trotting 'paritors:--O my little heart:--<br>
And I to be a corporal of his field, <br>
And wear his colours like a tumbler's hoop!<br>
What, I! I love! I sue! I seek a wife!<br>
A woman, that is like a German clock,<br>
Still a-repairing, ever out of frame,<br>
And never going aright, being a watch, <br>
But being watch'd that it may still go right!<br>
Nay, to be perjured, which is worst of all;<br>
And, among three, to love the worst of all;<br>
A wightly wanton with a velvet brow,<br>
With two pitch-balls stuck in her face for eyes; <br>
Ay, and by heaven, one that will do the deed<br>
Though Argus were her eunuch and her guard:<br>
And I to sigh for her! to watch for her!<br>
To pray for her! Go to; it is a plague<br>
That Cupid will impose for my neglect <br>
Of his almighty dreadful little might.<br>
Well, I will love, write, sigh, pray, sue and groan:<br>
Some men must love my lady and some Joan.
