          No more, but e'en a woman, and commanded <br>
      By such poor passion as the maid that milks<br>
      And does the meanest chares. It were for me<br>
      To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods;<br>
      To tell them that this world did equal theirs<br>
      Till they had stol'n our jewel. All's but naught; <br>
      Patience is scottish, and impatience does<br>
      Become a dog that's mad: then is it sin<br>
      To rush into the secret house of death,<br>
      Ere death dare come to us? How do you, women?<br>
      What, what! good cheer! Why, how now, Charmian! <br>
      My noble girls! Ah, women, women, look,<br>
      Our lamp is spent, it's out! Good sirs, take heart:<br>
      We'll bury him; and then, what's brave, what's noble,
      Let's do it after the high Roman fashion,<br>
      And make death proud to take us. Come, away:<br>
      This case of that huge spirit now is cold:<br>
      Ah, women, women! come; we have no friend<br>
      But resolution, and the briefest end. <br><br>

[Exeunt; those above bearing off MARK ANTONY's body]
