          That opportunity,	 <br>
Which then they had to take from 's, to resume, <br>
We have again. Remember, sir, my liege,	 <br>
The kings your ancestors, together with	  <br>
The natural bravery of your isle, which stands <br> 
As Neptune's park, ribbed and paled in <br>
With rocks unscaleable and roaring waters, <br>
With sands, that will not bear your enemies. boats, <br> 
But suck them up to the topmast. A kind of conquest <br>
Caesar's made here, but made not here his brag <br>
Of 'came, and saw, and overcame:' with shame-- <br>
The first that ever touch'd him--he was carried <br>
From off our coast, twice beaten; and his shipping-- <br>
Poor ignorant baubles!--on our terrible seas, <br>
Like egg-shells mov'd upon their surges, crack'd <br>
As easily 'gainst our rocks: for joy whereof <br>
The fam'd Cassibelan, who was once at point--  <br>
O giglot fortune!--to master Caesar's sword, <br>
Made Lud's town with rejoicing-fires bright, <br>
And Britons strut with courage.<br>
