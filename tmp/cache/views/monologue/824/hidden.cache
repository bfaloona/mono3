          Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio!<br>
My advocation is not now in tune;<br>
My lord is not my lord; nor should I know him,<br>
Were he in favour as in humour alter'd.<br>
So help me every spirit sanctified,<br>
As I have spoken for you all my best<br>
And stood within the blank of his displeasure<br>
For my free speech! you must awhile be patient:<br>
What I can do I will; and more I will<br>
Than for myself I dare: let that suffice you.<br>
