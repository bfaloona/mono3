          <div align=right>Let us on,</div>
And publish the occasion of our arms.<br>
The commonwealth is sick of their own choice;<br>
Their over-greedy love hath surfeited. <br>
An habitation giddy and unsure<br>
Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart.<br>
O thou fond many, with what loud applause<br>
Didst thou beat heaven with blessing Bolingbroke<br>
Before he was what thou wouldst have him be! <br>
And being now trimm'd in thine own desires,<br>
Thou, beastly feeder, art so full of him<br>
That thou provok'st thyself to cast him up.<br>
So, so, thou common dog, didst thou disgorge<br>
Thy glutton bosom of the royal Richard; <br>
And now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up,<br>
And howl'st to find it. What trust is in these times?<br>
They that, when Richard liv'd, would have him die<br>
Are now become enamour'd on his grave.<br>
Thou that threw'st dust upon his goodly head, <br>
When through proud London he came sighing on<br>
After th' admired heels of Bolingbroke,<br>
Criest now 'O earth, yield us that king again,<br>
And take thou this!' O thoughts of men accurs'd!<br>
Past and to come seems best; things present, worst.
