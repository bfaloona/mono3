          O what a rogue and peasant slave am I!<br>
Is it not monstrous that this player here,<br>
But in a fiction, in a dream of passion, <br>
Could force his soul so to his own conceit<br>
That, from her working, all his visage wann'd,<br>
Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,<br>
A broken voice, and his whole function suiting<br>
With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!<br>
For Hecuba!<br>
What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,<br>
That he should weep for her? What would he do,<br>
Had he the motive and the cue for passion<br>
That I have? He would drown the stage with tears<br>
And cleave the general ear with horrid speech;<br>
Make mad the guilty and appal the free,<br>
Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed<br>
The very faculties of eyes and ears.<br>
Yet I, <br>
A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak<br>
Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,<br>
And can say nothing! No, not for a king,<br>
Upon whose property and most dear life<br>
A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward? <br>
Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?<br>
Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?<br>
Tweaks me by th' nose? gives me the lie i' th' throat<br>
As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this, ha?<br>
'Swounds, I should take it! for it cannot be <br>
But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall<br>
To make oppression bitter, or ere this<br>
I should have fatted all the region kites<br>
With this slave's offal. Bloody bawdy villain!<br>
Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain! <br>
O, vengeance!<br>
Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,<br>
That I, the son of a dear father murther'd,<br>
Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,<br>
Must (like a whore) unpack my heart with words <br>
And fall a-cursing like a very drab,<br>
A scullion!<br>
Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! Hum, I have heard<br>
That guilty creatures, sitting at a play,<br>
Have by the very cunning of the scene <br>
Been struck so to the soul that presently<br>
They have proclaim'd their malefactions;<br>
For murther, though it have no tongue, will speak<br>
With most miraculous organ, I'll have these Players<br>
Play something like the murther of my father <br>
Before mine uncle. I'll observe his looks;<br>
I'll tent him to the quick. If he but blench,<br>
I know my course. The spirit that I have seen<br>
May be a devil; and the devil hath power<br>
T' assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps<br>
Out of my weakness and my melancholy,<br>
As he is very potent with such spirits,<br>
Abuses me to damn me. I'll have grounds<br>
More relative than this. The play's the thing<br>
Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King. <br>
