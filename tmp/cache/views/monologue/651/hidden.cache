      <div class="monologue_preview">
          Thus do I ever make my fool my purse: <br>
For I mine own gain'd knowledge should profane,<br>
If I would time expend with such a snipe.<br>
But for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor:<br>
And it is thought abroad, that 'twixt my sheets<br>
He has done my office: I know not if't be true; <br>
But I, for mere suspicion in that kind,<br>
Will do as if for surety. He holds me well;<br>
The better shall my purpose work on him.<br>
Cassio's a proper man: let me see now:<br>
To get his place and to plume up my will <br>
In double knavery—How, how? Let's see:—<br>
After some time, to abuse Othello's ear<br>
That he is too familiar with his wife.<br>
He hath a person and a smooth dispose<br>
To be suspected, framed to make women false.<br>
The Moor is of a free and open nature,<br>
That thinks men honest that but seem to be so,<br>
And will as tenderly be led by the nose
As asses are.<br>
I have't. It is engender'd. Hell and night <br>
Must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light.<br>
