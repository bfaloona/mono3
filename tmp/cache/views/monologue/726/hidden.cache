          What, have I scaped love-letters in the holiday-<br>
time of my beauty, and am I now a subject for them?<br>
Let me see.<br>
[Reads]<br>
'Ask me no reason why I love you; for though<br>
Love use Reason for his physician, he admits him<br>
not for his counsellor. You are not young, no more<br>
am I; go to then, there's sympathy: you are merry, <br>
so am I; ha, ha! then there's more sympathy: you<br>
love sack, and so do I; would you desire better<br>
sympathy? Let it suffice thee, Mistress Page,â€”at<br>
the least, if the love of soldier can suffice,â€”<br>
that I love thee. I will not say, pity me; 'tis <br>
not a soldier-like phrase: but I say, love me. By me,<br>
Thine own true knight,<br>
By day or night,<br>
Or any kind of light,<br>
With all his might <br>
For thee to fight, JOHN FALSTAFF'<br>
What a Herod of Jewry is this! O wicked<br>
world! One that is well-nigh worn to pieces with<br>
age to show himself a young gallant! What an<br>
unweighed behavior hath this Flemish drunkard<br>
pickedâ€”with the devil's name!â€”out of my<br>
conversation, that he dares in this manner assay me?<br>
Why, he hath not been thrice in my company! What<br>
should I say to him? I was then frugal of my<br>
mirth: Heaven forgive me! Why, I'll exhibit a bill<br>
in the parliament for the putting down of men. How<br>
shall I be revenged on him? for revenged I will be,<br>
as sure as his guts are made of puddings.
