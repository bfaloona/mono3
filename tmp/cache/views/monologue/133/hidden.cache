          Good Lord Boyet, my beauty, though but mean,<br>
Needs not the painted flourish of your praise:<br>
Beauty is bought by judgement of the eye,<br>
Not utter'd by base sale of chapmen's tongues:<br>
I am less proud to hear you tell my worth<br>
Than you much willing to be counted wise<br>
In spending your wit in the praise of mine.<br>
But now to task the tasker: good Boyet,<br>
You are not ignorant, all-telling fame <br>
Doth noise abroad, Navarre hath made a vow,<br>
Till painful study shall outwear three years,<br>
No woman may approach his silent court:<br>
Therefore to's seemeth it a needful course,<br>
Before we enter his forbidden gates, <br>
To know his pleasure; and in that behalf,<br>
Bold of your worthiness, we single you<br>
As our best-moving fair solicitor.<br>
Tell him, the daughter of the King of France,<br>
On serious business, craving quick dispatch, <br>
Importunes personal conference with his grace:<br>
Haste, signify so much; while we attend,<br>
Like humble-visaged suitors, his high will.
