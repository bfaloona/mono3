          See where she comes, apparell'd like the spring,<br>
Graces her subjects, and her thoughts the king<br>
Of every virtue gives renown to men! <br>
Her face the book of praises, where is read<br>
Nothing but curious pleasures, as from thence<br>
Sorrow were ever razed and testy wrath<br>
Could never be her mild companion.<br>
You gods that made me man, and sway in love,<br>
That have inflamed desire in my breast<br>
To taste the fruit of yon celestial tree,<br>
Or die in the adventure, be my helps,<br>
As I am son and servant to your will,<br>
To compass such a boundless happiness!
