          I left no ring with her: what means this lady?<br>
      Fortune forbid my outside have not charm'd her!<br>
      She made good view of me; indeed, so much,<br>
      That sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue,<br>
      For she did speak in starts distractedly.<br>
      She loves me, sure; the cunning of her passion<br>

      Invites me in this churlish messenger. <br>
      None of my lord's ring! why, he sent her none.<br>
      I am the man: if it be so, as 'tis,<br>
      Poor lady, she were better love a dream.<br>
      Disguise, I see, thou art a wickedness,<br>
      Wherein the pregnant enemy does much. <br>

      How easy is it for the proper-false<br>
      In women's waxen hearts to set their forms!<br>
      Alas, our frailty is the cause, not we!<br>
      For such as we are made of, such we be.<br>
      How will this fadge? my master loves her dearly; <br>
      And I, poor monster, fond as much on him;<br>

      And she, mistaken, seems to dote on me.<br>
      What will become of this? As I am man,<br>
      My state is desperate for my master's love;<br>
      As I am woman,.now alas the day!. <br>
      What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe!<br>
      O time! thou must untangle this, not I;<br>

      It is too hard a knot for me to untie! <p>
