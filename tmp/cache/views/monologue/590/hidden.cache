          <b>Tullus Aufidius.</b> <del>Condition!</del><br>
 I would I were a Roman; for I cannot,<br>
 Being a Volsce, be that I am. Condition!<br>
 What good condition can a treaty find<br>
 I' the part that is at mercy? Five times, CORIOLANUS, <br>
 I have fought with thee: so often hast thou beat me,<br>
 And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounter<br>
 As often as we eat. By the elements,<br>
 If e'er again I meet him beard to beard,<br>
 He's mine, or I am his: mine emulation <br>
 Hath not that honour in't it had; for where<br>
 I thought to crush him in an equal force,<br>
 True sword to sword, I'll potch at him some way<br>
 Or wrath or craft may get him. <br>
<br>
<del><b> First Soldier.</b> He's the devil. </del><br>
<br>
<b>Tullus Aufidius.</b> Bolder, though not so subtle. My valour's poison'd<br>
 With only suffering stain by him; for him<br>
 Shall fly out of itself: nor sleep nor sanctuary,<br>
 Being naked, sick, nor fane nor Capitol,<br>
 The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice, <br>
 Embarquements all of fury, shall lift up<br>
 Their rotten privilege and custom 'gainst<br>
 My hate to CORIOLANUS: where I find him, were it<br>
 At home, upon my brother's guard, even there,<br>
 Against the hospitable canon, would I <br>
 Wash my fierce hand in's heart. Go you to the city;<br>
 Learn how 'tis held; and what they are that must<br>
 Be hostages for Rome.
