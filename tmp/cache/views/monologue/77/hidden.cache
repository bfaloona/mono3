          Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie<br>	 
Which we ascribe to heaven: the fated sky<br> 
Gives us free scope; only doth backward pull <br>
Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull. <br>
What power is it which mounts my love so high; <br>
That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye? <br>
The mightiest space in fortune nature brings  <br>
To join like likes, and kiss like native things. <br>
Impossible be strange attempts to those <br>
That weigh their pains in sense, and do suppose <br>
What hath been cannot be: who ever strove <br>
To show her merit, that did miss her love?<br>
The king's disease, --my project may deceive me, <br>
But my intents are fix'd and will not leave me.<br>
