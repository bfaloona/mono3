          O, I am out of breath in this fond chase!<br>
The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace.<br>
Happy is Hermia, wheresoe'er she lies;<br>
For she hath blessed and attractive eyes. <br>
How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt tears:<br>
If so, my eyes are oftener wash'd than hers.<br>
No, no, I am as ugly as a bear;<br>
For beasts that meet me run away for fear:<br>
Therefore no marvel though Demetrius <br>
Do, as a monster fly my presence thus.<br>
What wicked and dissembling glass of mine<br>
Made me compare with Hermia's sphery eyne?<br>
But who is here? Lysander! on the ground!<br>
Dead? or asleep? I see no blood, no wound.<br>
Lysander if you live, good sir, awake.
