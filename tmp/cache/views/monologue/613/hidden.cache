          I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,<br>
As well as I do know your outward favour.<br>
Well, honour is the subject of my story.<br>
I cannot tell what you and other men<br>
Think of this life; but, for my single self,<br>
I had as lief not be as live to be <br>
In awe of such a thing as I myself.<br>
I was born free as Caesar; so were you:<br>
We both have fed as well, and we can both<br>
Endure the winter's cold as well as he:<br>
For once, upon a raw and gusty day,<br>
The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,<br>
Caesar said to me 'Darest thou, Cassius, now<br>
Leap in with me into this angry flood,<br>
And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word,<br>
Accoutred as I was, I plunged in <br>
And bade him follow; so indeed he did.<br>
The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it<br>
With lusty sinews, throwing it aside<br>
And stemming it with hearts of controversy;<br>
But ere we could arrive the point proposed, <br>
Caesar cried 'Help me, Cassius, or I sink!'<br>
I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,<br>
Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder<br>
The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber<br>
Did I the tired Caesar. And this man <br>
Is now become a god, and Cassius is<br>
A wretched creature and must bend his body,<br>
If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.<br>
He had a fever when he was in Spain,<br>
And when the fit was on him, I did mark <br>
How he did shake: 'tis true, this god did shake;<br>
His coward lips did from their colour fly,<br>
And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world<br>
Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:<br>
Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans <br>
Mark him and write his speeches in their books,<br>
Alas, it cried 'Give me some drink, Tintinius,'<br>
As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me<br>
A man of such a feeble temper should<br>
So get the start of the majestic world <br>
And bear the palm alone.
