          <div align='right'>God's bread! it makes me mad:</div>
Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,<br>
Alone, in company, still my care hath been <br>
To have her match'd: and having now provided<br>
A gentleman of noble parentage,<br>
Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,<br>
Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,<br>
Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man; <br>
And then to have a wretched puling fool,<br>
A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,<br>
To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,<br>
I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'<br>
But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you: <br>
Graze where you will you shall not house with me:<br>
Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.<br>
Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:<br>
An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;<br>
And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in 
the streets,<br>
For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,<br>
Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:<br>
Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn.
