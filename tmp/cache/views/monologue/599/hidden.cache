          O world, thy slippery turns! Friends now fast sworn,<br>
Whose double bosoms seem to wear one heart,<br>
Whose house, whose bed, whose meal, and exercise, <br>
Are still together, who twin, as 'twere, in love<br>
Unseparable, shall within this hour,<br>
On a dissension of a doit, break out<br>
To bitterest enmity: so, fellest foes,<br>
Whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep, <br>
To take the one the other, by some chance,<br>
Some trick not worth an egg, shall grow dear friends<br>
And interjoin their issues. So with me:<br>
My birth-place hate I, and my love's upon<br>
This enemy town. I'll enter: if he slay me, <br>
He does fair justice; if he give me way,<br>
I'll do his country service.
