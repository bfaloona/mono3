          What say you? can you love the gentleman?<br>
This night you shall behold him at our feast;<br>
Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,<br>
And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;<br>
Examine every married lineament,<br>
And see how one another lends content<br>
And what obscured in this fair volume lies<br>
Find written in the margent of his eyes.<br>
This precious book of love, this unbound lover,<br>
To beautify him, only lacks a cover:<br>
The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride<br>
For fair without the fair within to hide: <br>
That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,<br>
That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;<br>
So shall you share all that he doth possess,<br>
By having him, making yourself no less.
