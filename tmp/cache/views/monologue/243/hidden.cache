          <b>Antony.</b> Hark! the land bids me tread no more upon't;<br>
      It is ashamed to bear me! Friends, come hither:<br>
      I am so lated in the world, that I<br>
      Have lost my way for ever: I have a ship<br>
      Laden with gold; take that, divide it; fly, <br>
      And make your peace with Caesar. <br><br>

<del><b>All.</b> Fly! not we. </del><br><br>

<b>Antony.</b> I have fled myself; and have instructed cowards<br>
      To run and show their shoulders. Friends, be gone;<br>
      I have myself resolved upon a course <br>
      Which has no need of you; be gone:<br>
      My treasure's in the harbour, take it. O,<br>
      I follow'd that I blush to look upon:<br>
      My very hairs do mutiny; for the white<br>
      Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them <br>
      For fear and doting. Friends, be gone: you shall<br>
      Have letters from me to some friends that will<br>
      Sweep your way for you. Pray you, look not sad,<br>
      Nor make replies of loathness: take the hint<br>
      Which my despair proclaims; let that be left<br>
      Which leaves itself: to the sea-side straightway:<br>
      I will possess you of that ship and treasure.<br>
      Leave me, I pray, a little: pray you now:<br>
      Nay, do so; for, indeed, I have lost command,<br>
      Therefore I pray you: I'll see you by and by.
