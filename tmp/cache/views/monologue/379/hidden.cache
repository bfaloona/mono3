          Though no man lesser fears the Greeks than I<br>
As far as toucheth my particular, Yet, dread Priam,<br>
There is no lady of more softer bowels, <br>
More spongy to suck in the sense of fear,<br>
More ready to cry out 'Who knows what follows?'<br>
Than Hector is: the wound of peace is surety,<br>
Surety secure; but modest doubt is call'd<br>
The beacon of the wise, the tent that searches <br>
To the bottom of the worst. Let Helen go:<br>
Since the first sword was drawn about this question,<br>
Every tithe soul, 'mongst many thousand dismes,<br>
Hath been as dear as Helen; I mean, of ours:<br>
If we have lost so many tenths of ours, <br>
To guard a thing not ours nor worth to us,<br>
Had it our name, the value of one ten,<br>
What merit's in that reason which denies<br>
The yielding of her up?
