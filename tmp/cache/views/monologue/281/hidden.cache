          <i>[Waking]</i>Sleep, thou hast been a grandsire, and begot<br>
A father to me; and thou hast created<br>
A mother and two brothers: but, O scorn!<br>
Gone! they went hence so soon as they were born:<br>
And so I am awake. Poor wretches that depend <br>
On greatness' favour dream as I have done,<br>
Wake and find nothing. But, alas, I swerve:<br>
Many dream not to find, neither deserve,<br>
And yet are steep'd in favours: so am I,<br>
That have this golden chance and know not why.<br>
What fairies haunt this ground? A book? O rare one!<br>
Be not, as is our fangled world, a garment<br>
Nobler than that it covers: let thy effects<br>
So follow, to be most unlike our courtiers,<br>
As good as promise. <br>
<i>[Reads]</i><br>
'When as a lion's whelp shall, to himself unknown,<br>
without seeking find, and be embraced by a piece of<br>
tender air; and when from a stately cedar shall be<br>
lopped branches, which, being dead many years, <br>
shall after revive, be jointed to the old stock and<br>
freshly grow; then shall Posthumus end his miseries,<br>
Britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty.'<br>
'Tis still a dream, or else such stuff as madmen<br>
Tongue and brain not; either both or nothing; 3300<br>
Or senseless speaking or a speaking such<br>
As sense cannot untie. Be what it is,<br>
The action of my life is like it, which<br>
I'll keep, if but for sympathy. <br>
