          <b>Goneril.</b> By day and night, he wrongs me! Every hour<br>
 He flashes into one gross crime or other<br>
 That sets us all at odds. I'll not endure it.<br>
 His knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids us <br>
 On every trifle. When he returns from hunting,<br>
 I will not speak with him. Say I am sick.<br>
 If you come slack of former services,<br>
 You shall do well; the fault of it I'll answer. <br>
<br>
<i>[Horns within.]</i><br>
<br>
<del><b>Oswald.</b> He's coming, madam; I hear him. </del><br>
<br>
<b>Goneril.<b> Put on what weary negligence you please,<br>
 You and your fellows. I'd have it come to question.<br>
 If he distaste it, let him to our sister,<br>
 Whose mind and mine I know in that are one, <br>
 Not to be overrul'd. Idle old man,<br>
 That still would manage those authorities<br>
 That he hath given away! Now, by my life,<br>
 Old fools are babes again, and must be us'd<br>
 With checks as flatteries, when they are seen abus'd. <br>
 Remember what I have said.
