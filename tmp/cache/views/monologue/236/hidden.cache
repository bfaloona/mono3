          <div align='right'>O Charmian,</div>
Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he, or sits he?<br>
Or does he walk? or is he on his horse? <br>
O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!<br>
Do bravely, horse! for wot'st thou whom thou movest?<br>
The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm<br>
And burgonet of men. He's speaking now,<br>
Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?'<br>
For so he calls me: now I feed myself<br>
With most delicious poison. Think on me,<br>
That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,<br>
And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,<br>
When thou wast here above the ground, I was <br>
A morsel for a monarch: and great Pompey<br>
Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;<br>
There would he anchor his aspect and die<br>
With looking on his life.
