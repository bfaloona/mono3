'They met me in the day of success: and I have <br>
      learned by the perfectest report, they have more in<br>
      them than mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire<br>
      to question them further, they made themselves air,<br>
      into which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in<br>
      the wonder of it, came missives from the king, who <br>
      all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor;' by which title,<br>
      before, these weird sisters saluted me, and referred<br>
      me to the coming on of time, with 'Hail, king that<br>
      shalt be!' This have I thought good to deliver<br>
      thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou<br>
      mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being<br>
      ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it<br>
      to thy heart, and farewell.'<br>
      Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be<br>
      What thou art promised: yet do I fear thy nature;<br>
      It is too full o' the milk of human kindness<br>
      To catch the nearest way: thou wouldst be great;<br>
      Art not without ambition, but without<br>
      The illness should attend it: what thou wouldst highly,<br>
      That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false, <br>
      And yet wouldst wrongly win: thou'ldst have, great Glamis,<br>
      That which cries 'Thus thou must do, if thou have it;<br>
      And that which rather thou dost fear to do<br>
      Than wishest should be undone.' Hie thee hither,<br>
      That I may pour my spirits in thine ear; <br>
      And chastise with the valour of my tongue<br>
      All that impedes thee from the golden round,<br>
      Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem<br>
      To have thee crown'd withal.
