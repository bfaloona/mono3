'By heaven, that thou art fair, is most infallible;
      true, that thou art beauteous; truth itself, that
      thou art lovely. More fairer than fair, beautiful
      than beauteous, truer than truth itself, have
      commiseration on thy heroical vassal! The
      magnanimous and most illustrate king Cophetua set
      eye upon the pernicious and indubitate beggar 
      Zenelophon; and he it was that might rightly say,
      Veni, vidi, vici; which to annothanize in the
      vulgar,--O base and obscure vulgar!--videlicet, He
      came, saw, and overcame: he came, one; saw two;
      overcame, three. Who came? the king: why did he 
      come? to see: why did he see? to overcome: to
      whom came he? to the beggar: what saw he? the
      beggar: who overcame he? the beggar. The
      conclusion is victory: on whose side? the king's.
      The captive is enriched: on whose side? the 
      beggar's. The catastrophe is a nuptial: on whose
      side? the king's: no, on both in one, or one in
      both. I am the king; for so stands the comparison:
      thou the beggar; for so witnesseth thy lowliness.
      Shall I command thy love? I may: shall I enforce 
      thy love? I could: shall I entreat thy love? I
      will. What shalt thou exchange for rags? robes;
      for tittles? titles; for thyself? me. Thus,
      expecting thy reply, I profane my lips on thy foot,
      my eyes on thy picture. and my heart on thy every 
      part. Thine, in the dearest design of industry,
      DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO.'
      Thus dost thou hear the Nemean lion roar
      'Gainst thee, thou lamb, that standest as his prey.
      Submissive fall his princely feet before, 
      And he from forage will incline to play:
      But if thou strive, poor soul, what art thou then?
      Food for his rage, repasture for his den.
