          That nature, being sick of man's unkindness,<br>
Should yet be hungry! Common mother, thou,<br>
[Digging]<br>
Whose womb unmeasurable, and infinite breast, <br>
Teems, and feeds all; whose self-same mettle,<br>
Whereof thy proud child, arrogant man, is puff'd,<br>
Engenders the black toad and adder blue,<br>
The gilded newt and eyeless venom'd worm,<br>
With all the abhorred births below crisp heaven <br>
Whereon Hyperion's quickening fire doth shine;<br>
Yield him, who all thy human sons doth hate,<br>
From forth thy plenteous bosom, one poor root!<br>
Ensear thy fertile and conceptious womb,<br>
Let it no more bring out ingrateful man! <br>
Go great with tigers, dragons, wolves, and bears;<br>
Teem with new monsters, whom thy upward face<br>
Hath to the marbled mansion all above<br>
Never presented!—O, a root,—dear thanks!—<br>
Dry up thy marrows, vines, and plough-torn leas; <br>
Whereof ungrateful man, with liquorish draughts<br>
And morsels unctuous, greases his pure mind,<br>
That from it all consideration slips!
