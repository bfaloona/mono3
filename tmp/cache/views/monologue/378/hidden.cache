          Sir, I propose not merely to myself<br>
The pleasures such a beauty brings with it; <br>
But I would have the soil of her fair rape<br>
Wiped off, in honourable keeping her.<br>
What treason were it to the ransack'd queen,<br>
Disgrace to your great worths and shame to me,<br>
Now to deliver her possession up <br>
On terms of base compulsion! Can it be<br>
That so degenerate a strain as this<br>
Should once set footing in your generous bosoms?<br>
There's not the meanest spirit on our party<br>
Without a heart to dare or sword to draw <br>
When Helen is defended, nor none so noble<br>
Whose life were ill bestow'd or death unfamed<br>
Where Helen is the subject; then, I say,<br>
Well may we fight for her whom, we know well,<br>
The world's large spaces cannot parallel.
