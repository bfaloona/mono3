          <div align=right>Think it no more.</div>
For nature crescent does not grow alone<br>
In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,<br>
The inward service of the mind and soul<br>
Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,<br>
And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch<br>
The virtue of his will; but you must fear,<br>
His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;<br>
For he himself is subject to his birth.<br>
He may not, as unvalued persons do,<br>
Carve for himself, for on his choice depends<br>
The safety and health of this whole state, <br>
And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd<br>
Unto the voice and yielding of that body<br>
Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,<br>
It fits your wisdom so far to believe it<br>
As he in his particular act and place <br>
May give his saying deed; which is no further<br>
Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.<br>
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain<br>
If with too credent ear you list his songs,<br>
Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open <br>
To his unmast'red importunity.<br>
Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,<br>
And keep you in the rear of your affection,<br>
Out of the shot and danger of desire.<br>
The chariest maid is prodigal enough <br>
If she unmask her beauty to the moon.<br>
Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes.<br>
The canker galls the infants of the spring<br>
Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd,<br>
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth <br>
Contagious blastments are most imminent.<br>
Be wary then; best safety lies in fear.<br>
Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.<br>
