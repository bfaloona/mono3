          <b>Othello</b><div align=right> Had it pleased heaven</div>
      To try me with affliction; had they rain'd<br>
      All kinds of sores and shames on my bare head.<br>
      Steep'd me in poverty to the very lips,<br>
      Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes,<br>
      I should have found in some place of my soul <br>
      A drop of patience: but, alas, to make me<br>
      A fixed figure for the time of scorn<br>
      To point his slow unmoving finger at!<br>
      Yet could I bear that too; well, very well:<br>
      But there, where I have garner'd up my heart, <br>
      Where either I must live, or bear no life;<br>
      The fountain from the which my current runs,<br>
      Or else dries up; to be discarded thence!<br>
      Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads<br>
      To knot and gender in! Turn thy complexion there, <br>
      Patience, thou young and rose-lipp'd cherubin,â€”<br>
      Ay, there, look grim as hell! <br><br>

<del><b>Desdemona.</b> I hope my noble lord esteems me honest.</del> <br><br>

    <b>Othello.</b> O, ay; as summer flies are in the shambles,<br>
      That quicken even with blowing. O thou weed, <br>
      Who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet<br>
      That the sense aches at thee, would thou hadst<br>
      ne'er been born! <br>

<del><b>Desdemona.</b> Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed? </del><br><br>

<b>Othello.</b> Was this fair paper, this most goodly book, <br>
      Made to write 'whore' upon? What committed!<br>
      Committed! O thou public commoner!<br>
      I should make very forges of my cheeks,<br>
      That would to cinders burn up modesty,<br>
      Did I but speak thy deeds. What committed! <br>
      Heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks,<br>
      The bawdy wind that kisses all it meets<br>
      Is hush'd within the hollow mine of earth,<br>
      And will not hear it. What committed!<br>
      Impudent strumpet! <br>
