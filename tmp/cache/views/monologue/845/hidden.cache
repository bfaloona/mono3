          <div align="right">Sir, spare your threats:</div>
The bug which you would fright me with I seek.<br>
To me can life be no commodity: <br>
The crown and comfort of my life, your favour,<br>
I do give lost; for I do feel it gone,<br>
But know not how it went. My second joy<br>
And first-fruits of my body, from his presence<br>
I am barr'd, like one infectious. My third comfort <br>
Starr'd most unluckily, is from my breast,<br>
The innocent milk in its most innocent mouth,<br>
Haled out to murder: myself on every post<br>
Proclaimed a strumpet: with immodest hatred<br>
The child-bed privilege denied, which 'longs <br>
To women of all fashion; lastly, hurried<br>
Here to this place, i' the open air, before<br>
I have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,<br>
Tell me what blessings I have here alive,<br>
That I should fear to die? Therefore proceed.<br>
But yet hear this: mistake me not; no life,<br>
I prize it not a straw, but for mine honour,<br>
Which I would free, if I shall be condemn'd<br>
Upon surmises, all proofs sleeping else<br>
But what your jealousies awake, I tell you <br>
'Tis rigor and not law. Your honours all,<br>
I do refer me to the oracle:<br>
Apollo be my judge!
