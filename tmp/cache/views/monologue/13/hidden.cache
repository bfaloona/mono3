          Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!<br>
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,<br>
And you are stay'd for. There- my blessing with thee!<br>
And these few precepts in thy memory<br>
Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,<br>
Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.<br>
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar:<br>
Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,<br>
Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;<br>
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment <br>
Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware<br>
Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,<br>
Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.<br>
Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice;<br>
Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.<br>
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,<br>
But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;<br>
For the apparel oft proclaims the man,<br>
And they in France of the best rank and station<br>
Are most select and generous, chief in that. <br>
Neither a borrower nor a lender be;<br>
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,<br>
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.<br>
This above all- to thine own self be true,<br>
And it must follow, as the night the day, <br>
Thou canst not then be false to any man.<br>
Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!<br>
