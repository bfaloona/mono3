          For worms, brave Percy: fare thee well, great heart!<br>
Ill-weaved ambition, how much art thou shrunk!<br>
When that this body did contain a spirit,<br>
A kingdom for it was too small a bound;<br>
But now two paces of the vilest earth <br>
Is room enough: this earth that bears thee dead<br>
Bears not alive so stout a gentleman.<br>
If thou wert sensible of courtesy,<br>
I should not make so dear a show of zeal:<br>
But let my favours hide thy mangled face; <br>
And, even in thy behalf, I'll thank myself<br>
For doing these fair rites of tenderness.<br>
Adieu, and take thy praise with thee to heaven!<br>
Thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave,<br>
But not remember'd in thy epitaph! <br>
[He spieth FALSTAFF on the ground]<br>
What, old acquaintance! could not all this flesh<br>
Keep in a little life? Poor Jack, farewell!<br>
I could have better spared a better man:<br>
O, I should have a heavy miss of thee, <br>
If I were much in love with vanity!<br>
Death hath not struck so fat a deer to-day,<br>
Though many dearer, in this bloody fray.<br>
Embowell'd will I see thee by and by:<br>
Till then in blood by noble Percy lie.
