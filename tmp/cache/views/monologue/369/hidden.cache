          Princes,<br>
What grief hath set the jaundice on your cheeks?<br>
The ample proposition that hope makes<br>
In all designs begun on earth below<br>
Fails in the promised largeness: cheques and disasters<br>
Grow in the veins of actions highest rear'd,<br>
As knots, by the conflux of meeting sap,<br>
Infect the sound pine and divert his grain<br>
Tortive and errant from his course of growth.<br>
Nor, princes, is it matter new to us<br>
That we come short of our suppose so far<br>
That after seven years' siege yet Troy walls stand;<br>
Sith every action that hath gone before,<br>
Whereof we have record, trial did draw<br>
Bias and thwart, not answering the aim,<br>
And that unbodied figure of the thought<br>
That gave't surmised shape. Why then, you princes,<br>
Do you with cheeks abash'd behold our works,<br>
And call them shames? which are indeed nought else<br>
But the protractive trials of great Jove<br>
To find persistive constancy in men:<br>
The fineness of which metal is not found<br>
In fortune's love; for then the bold and coward,<br>
The wise and fool, the artist and unread,<br>
The hard and soft seem all affined and kin: <br>
But, in the wind and tempest of her frown,<br>
Distinction, with a broad and powerful fan,<br>
Puffing at all, winnows the light away;<br>
And what hath mass or matter, by itself<br>
Lies rich in virtue and unmingled.
