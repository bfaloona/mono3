          <div align='right'>Thou speak'st aright;</div>
I am that merry wanderer of the night.<br>
I jest to Oberon and make him smile<br>
When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,<br>
Neighing in likeness of a filly foal:<br>
And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl,<br>
In very likeness of a roasted crab,<br>
And when she drinks, against her lips I bob<br>
And on her wither'd dewlap pour the ale.<br>
The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,<br>
Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me; <br>
Then slip I from her bum, down topples she,<br>
And 'tailor' cries, and falls into a cough;<br>
And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh,<br>
And waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear<br>
A merrier hour was never wasted there.<br>
But, room, fairy! here comes Oberon.
