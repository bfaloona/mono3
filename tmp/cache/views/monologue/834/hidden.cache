           King, be thy thoughts imperious, like thy name. <br>
Is the sun dimm'd, that gnats do fly in it?<br>
The eagle suffers little birds to sing,<br>
And is not careful what they mean thereby,<br>
Knowing that with the shadow of his wings<br>
He can at pleasure stint their melody: <br>
Even so mayst thou the giddy men of Rome.<br>
Then cheer thy spirit : for know, thou emperor,<br>
I will enchant the old Andronicus<br>
With words more sweet, and yet more dangerous,<br>
Than baits to fish, or honey-stalks to sheep, <br>
When as the one is wounded with the bait,<br>
The other rotted with delicious feed.
