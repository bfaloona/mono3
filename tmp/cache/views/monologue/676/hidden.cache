          O blessed breeding sun, draw from the earth<br>
Rotten humidity; below thy sister's orb <br>
Infect the air! Twinn'd brothers of one womb,<br>
Whose procreation, residence, and birth,<br>
Scarce is dividant, touch them with several fortunes;<br>
The greater scorns the lesser: not nature,<br>
To whom all sores lay siege, can bear great fortune, <br>
But by contempt of nature.<br>
Raise me this beggar, and deny 't that lord;<br>
The senator shall bear contempt hereditary,<br>
The beggar native honour.<br>
It is the pasture lards the rother's sides, <br>
The want that makes him lean. Who dares, who dares,<br>
In purity of manhood stand upright,<br>
And say 'This man's a flatterer?' if one be,<br>
So are they all; for every grise of fortune<br>
Is smooth'd by that below: the learned pate<br>
Ducks to the golden fool: all is oblique;<br>
There's nothing level in our cursed natures,<br>
But direct villany. Therefore, be abhorr'd<br>
All feasts, societies, and throngs of men!<br>
His semblable, yea, himself, Timon disdains:<br>
Destruction fang mankind! Earth, yield me roots!<br>
[Digging]<br>
Who seeks for better of thee, sauce his palate<br>
With thy most operant poison! What is here?<br>
Gold? yellow, glittering, precious gold? No, gods, <br>
I am no idle votarist: roots, you clear heavens!<br>
Thus much of this will make black white, foul fair,<br>
Wrong right, base noble, old young, coward valiant.<br>
Ha, you gods! why this? what this, you gods? Why, this<br>
Will lug your priests and servants from your sides, <br>
Pluck stout men's pillows from below their heads:<br>
This yellow slave<br>
Will knit and break religions, bless the accursed,<br>
Make the hoar leprosy adored, place thieves<br>
And give them title, knee and approbation <br>
With senators on the bench: this is it<br>
That makes the wappen'd widow wed again;<br>
She, whom the spital-house and ulcerous sores<br>
Would cast the gorge at, this embalms and spices<br>
To the April day again. Come, damned earth,<br>
Thou common whore of mankind, that put'st odds<br>
Among the route of nations, I will make thee<br>
Do thy right nature.
