          Then are we all undone.<br>
It is not possible, it cannot be,<br>
The king should keep his word in loving us;<br>
He will suspect us still and find a time<br>
To punish this offence in other faults:<br>
Suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes;<br>
For treason is but trusted like the fox,<br>
Who, ne'er so tame, so cherish'd and lock'd up,<br>
Will have a wild trick of his ancestors.<br>
Look how we can, or sad or merrily,<br>
Interpretation will misquote our looks,<br>
And we shall feed like oxen at a stall,
The better cherish'd, still the nearer death. <br>
My nephew's trespass may be well forgot;<br>
it hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood,<br>
And an adopted name of privilege,<br>
A hair-brain'd Hotspur, govern'd by a spleen:<br>
All his offences live upon my head <br>
And on his father's; we did train him on,<br>
And, his corruption being ta'en from us,<br>
We, as the spring of all, shall pay for all.<br>
Therefore, good cousin, let not Harry know,<br>
In any case, the offer of the king.
