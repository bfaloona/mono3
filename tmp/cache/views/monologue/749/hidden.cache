Which any print of goodness wilt not take,<br>
Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee,<br>
Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour<br>
One thing or other: when thou didst not, savage,<br>
Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like<br>
A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes<br>
With words that made them known. But thy vile race,<br>
Though thou didst learn, had that in't which good natures<br>
Could not abide to be with; therefore wast thou<br>
Deservedly confined into this rock,<br>
Who hadst deserved more than a prison.
