          Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?<br>
What tributaries follow him to Rome,<br>
To grace in captive bonds his chariot-wheels? 35<br>
You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!<br>
O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,<br>
Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft<br>
Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements,<br>
To towers and windows, yea, to chimney-tops,<br>
Your infants in your arms, and there have sat<br>
The livelong day, with patient expectation,<br>
To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome:<br>
And when you saw his chariot but appear,<br>
Have you not made an universal shout,<br>
That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,<br>
To hear the replication of your sounds<br>
Made in her concave shores?<br>
And do you now put on your best attire?<br>
And do you now cull out a holiday?<br>
And do you now strew flowers in his way<br>
That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood? Be gone!<br>
Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,<br>
Pray to the gods to intermit the plague<br>
That needs must light on this ingratitude.
