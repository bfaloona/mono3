      <div class="monologue_preview">
          It pleased your majesty to turn your looks<br>
Of favour from myself and all our house;<br>
And yet I must remember you, my lord, <br>
We were the first and dearest of your friends.<br>
For you my staff of office did I break<br>
In Richard's time; and posted day and night<br>
to meet you on the way, and kiss your hand,<br>
When yet you were in place and in account<br>
Nothing so strong and fortunate as I.<br>
It was myself, my brother and his son,<br>
That brought you home and boldly did outdare<br>
The dangers of the time. You swore to us,<br>
And you did swear that oath at Doncaster,<br>
That you did nothing purpose 'gainst the state;<br>
Nor claim no further than your new-fall'n right,<br>
The seat of Gaunt, dukedom of Lancaster:<br>
To this we swore our aid. But in short space<br>
It rain'd down fortune showering on your head;<br>
And such a flood of greatness fell on you,<br>
What with our help, what with the absent king,<br>
What with the injuries of a wanton time,<br>
The seeming sufferances that you had borne,<br>
And the contrarious winds that held the king <br>
So long in his unlucky Irish wars<br>
That all in England did repute him dead:<br>
And from this swarm of fair advantages<br>
You took occasion to be quickly woo'd<br>
To gripe the general sway into your hand;<br>
Forget your oath to us at Doncaster;<br>
And being fed by us you used us so<br>
As that ungentle hull, the cuckoo's bird,<br>
Useth the sparrow; did oppress our nest;<br>
Grew by our feeding to so great a bulk<br>
That even our love durst not come near your sight<br>
For fear of swallowing; but with nimble wing<br>
We were enforced, for safety sake, to fly<br>
Out of sight and raise this present head;<br>
Whereby we stand opposed by such means <br>
As you yourself have forged against yourself<br>
By unkind usage, dangerous countenance,<br>
And violation of all faith and troth<br>
Sworn to us in your younger enterprise.
