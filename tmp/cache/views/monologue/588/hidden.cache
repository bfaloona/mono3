          <b> Menenius Agrippa.</b> I tell you, friends, most charitable care<br>
 Have the patricians of you. For your wants,<br>
 Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well<br>
 Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them<br>
 Against the Roman state, whose course will on<br>
 The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs<br>
 Of more strong link asunder than can ever<br>
 Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,<br>
 The gods, not the patricians, make it, and<br>
 Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,<br>
 You are transported by calamity<br>
 Thither where more attends you, and you slander<br>
 The helms o' the state, who care for you like fathers,<br>
 When you curse them as enemies. <br>
<br>
<del><b>First Citizen.</b> Care for us! True, indeed! They ne'er cared for us<br>
 yet: suffer us to famish, and their store-houses<br>
 crammed with grain; make edicts for usury, to<br>
 support usurers; repeal daily any wholesome act<br>
 established against the rich, and provide more <br>
 piercing statutes daily, to chain up and restrain<br>
 the poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will; and<br>
 there's all the love they bear us.</del> <br>
<br>
<b>Menenius Agrippa.</b> Either you must<br>
 Confess yourselves wondrous malicious, <br>
 Or be accused of folly. I shall tell you<br>
 A pretty tale: it may be you have heard it;<br>
 But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture<br>
 To stale 't a little more. <br>
<br>
<del><b>First Citizen.</b> Well, I'll hear it, sir: yet you must not think to <br>
 fob off our disgrace with a tale: but, an 't please<br>
 you, deliver. </del><br>
<br>
<b>Menenius Agrippa.</b> There was a time when all the body's members<br>
 Rebell'd against the belly, thus accused it:<br>
 That only like a gulf it did remain <br>
 I' the midst o' the body, idle and unactive,<br>
 Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing<br>
 Like labour with the rest, where the other instruments<br>
 Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,<br>
 And, mutually participate, did minister <br>
 Unto the appetite and affection common<br>
 Of the whole body. The belly answer'dâ€” <br>
<br>
<del><b>First Citizen.</b> Well, sir, what answer made the belly? </del><br>
<br>
<b>Menenius Agrippa.</b> Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,<br>
 Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thusâ€” <br>
 For, look you, I may make the belly smile<br>
 As well as speakâ€”it tauntingly replied<br>
 To the discontented members, the mutinous parts<br>
 That envied his receipt; even so most fitly<br>
 As you malign our senators for that <br>
 They are not such as you.
