          You have done that you should be sorry for. <br>
There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,<br>
For I am arm'd so strong in honesty<br>
That they pass by me as the idle wind,<br>
Which I respect not. I did send to you<br>
For certain sums of gold, which you denied me:<br>
For I can raise no money by vile means:<br>
By heaven, I had rather coin my heart,<br>
And drop my blood for drachmas, than to wring<br>
From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash<br>
By any indirection: I did send <br>
To you for gold to pay my legions,<br>
Which you denied me: was that done like Cassius?<br>
Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so?<br>
When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous,<br>
To lock such rascal counters from his friends, <br>
Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts;<br>
Dash him to pieces!
