          <div align=right>Touch me not so near:</div>
I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth <br>
Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio;<br>
Yet, I persuade myself, to speak the truth<br>
Shall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general.<br>
Montano and myself being in speech,<br>
There comes a fellow crying out for help:<br>
And Cassio following him with determined sword,<br>
To execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman<br>
Steps in to Cassio, and entreats his pause:<br>
Myself the crying fellow did pursue,<br>
Lest by his clamour—as it so fell out— <br>
The town might fall in fright: he, swift of foot,<br>
Outran my purpose; and I return'd the rather<br>
For that I heard the clink and fall of swords,<br>
And Cassio high in oath; which till to-night<br>
I ne'er might say before. When I came back— <br>
For this was brief—I found them close together,<br>
At blow and thrust; even as again they were<br>
When you yourself did part them.<br>
More of this matter cannot I report:<br>
But men are men; the best sometimes forget:<br>
Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,<br>
As men in rage strike those that wish them best,<br>
Yet surely Cassio, I believe, received<br>
From him that fled some strange indignity,<br>
Which patience could not pass. <br>
