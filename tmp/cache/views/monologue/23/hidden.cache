          <b>Hamlet.</b> Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounc'd it to you,
      trippingly on the tongue. But if you mouth it, as many of our
      players do, I had as live the town crier spoke my lines. Nor do 
      not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all
      gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I may say)
      whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a
      temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the
      soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to
      tatters, to very rags, to split the cars of the groundlings, who
      (for the most part) are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb
      shows and noise. I would have such a fellow whipp'd for o'erdoing
      Termagant. It out-herods Herod. Pray you avoid it. <br><br>

 <del><b> First Player.</b> I warrant your honour. </del><br><br>

<b> Hamlet.</b> Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be your
      tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with
      this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of
      nature: for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing,
      whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as
      'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show Virtue her own feature,
      scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his
      form and pressure. Now this overdone, or come tardy off, though
      it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious
      grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance 
      o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I
      have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly (not to
      speak it profanely), that, neither having the accent of
      Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so
      strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of Nature's 
      journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated
      humanity so abominably. <br><br>

<del><b> First Player.</b> I hope we have reform'd that indifferently with us, sir. </del><br><br>

<b>Hamlet.</b> O, reform it altogether! And let those that play your clowns
      speak no more than is set down for them. For there be of them 
      that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren
      spectators to laugh too, though in the mean time some necessary
      question of the play be then to be considered. That's villanous
      and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go
      make you ready. <br><br>
