      <div class="monologue_preview">
          The kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing.<br>
Our sport shall be to take what they mistake: <br>
And what poor duty cannot do, noble respect<br>
Takes it in might, not merit.<br>
Where I have come, great clerks have purposed<br>
To greet me with premeditated welcomes;<br>
Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,<br>
Make periods in the midst of sentences,<br>
Throttle their practised accent in their fears<br>
And in conclusion dumbly have broke off,<br>
Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,<br>
Out of this silence yet I pick'd a welcome; <br>
And in the modesty of fearful duty<br>
I read as much as from the rattling tongue<br>
Of saucy and audacious eloquence.<br>
Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity<br>
In least speak most, to my capacity.
