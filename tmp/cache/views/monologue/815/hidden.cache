          Not only, sir, this your all-licens'd fool,<br>
But other of your insolent retinue<br>
Do hourly carp and quarrel, breaking forth<br>
In rank and not-to-be-endured riots. Sir, <br>
I had thought, by making this well known unto you,<br>
To have found a safe redress, but now grow fearful,<br>
By what yourself, too, late have spoke and done,<br>
That you protect this course, and put it on<br>
By your allowance; which if you should, the fault <br>
Would not scape censure, nor the redresses sleep,<br>
Which, in the tender of a wholesome weal,<br>
Might in their working do you that offence<br>
Which else were shame, that then necessity<br>
Must call discreet proceeding.
