          I can but say their protestation over; <br>
So much, dear liege, I have already sworn,<br>
That is, to live and study here three years.<br>
But there are other strict observances;<br>
As, not to see a woman in that term,<br>
Which I hope well is not enrolled there;<br>
And one day in a week to touch no food<br>
And but one meal on every day beside,<br>
The which I hope is not enrolled there;<br>

And then, to sleep but three hours in the night,<br>
And not be seen to wink of all the day.<br>
When I was wont to think no harm all night<br>
And make a dark night too of half the day.<br>
Which I hope well is not enrolled there:<br>
O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,<br>
Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!<br>
