      <div class="monologue_preview">
          Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,<br>
That owe yourselves, your lives and services<br>
To this imperial throne. There is no bar<br>
To make against your highness' claim to France<br>
But this, which they produce from Pharamond,<br>
'In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant:'<br>
'No woman shall succeed in Salique land:'<br>
Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze <br>
To be the realm of France, and Pharamond<br>
The founder of this law and female bar.<br>
Yet their own authors faithfully affirm<br>
That the land Salique is in Germany,<br>
Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe; <br>
Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,<br>
There left behind and settled certain French;<br>
Who, holding in disdain the German women<br>
For some dishonest manners of their life,<br>
Establish'd then this law; to wit, no female <br>
Should be inheritrix in Salique land:<br>
Which Salique, as I said, 'twixt Elbe and Sala,<br>
Is at this day in Germany call'd Meisen.<br>
Then doth it well appear that Salique law<br>
Was not devised for the realm of France: <br>
Nor did the French possess the Salique land<br>
Until four hundred one and twenty years<br>
After defunction of King Pharamond,<br>
Idly supposed the founder of this law;<br>
Who died within the year of our redemption <br>
Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great<br>
Subdued the Saxons, and did seat the French<br>
Beyond the river Sala, in the year<br>
Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,<br>
King Pepin, which deposed Childeric, <br>
Did, as heir general, being descended<br>
Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,<br>
Make claim and title to the crown of France.<br>
Hugh Capet also, who usurped the crown<br>
Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male <br>
Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,<br>
To find his title with some shows of truth,<br>
'Through, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught,<br>
Convey'd himself as heir to the Lady Lingare,<br>
Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son <br>
To Lewis the emperor, and Lewis the son<br>
Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,<br>
Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,<br>
Could not keep quiet in his conscience,<br>
Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied <br>
That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,<br>
Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,<br>
Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine:<br>
By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great<br>
Was re-united to the crown of France. <br>
So that, as clear as is the summer's sun.<br>
King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,<br>
King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear<br>
To hold in right and title of the female:<br>
So do the kings of France unto this day; <br>
Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law<br>
To bar your highness claiming from the female,<br>
And rather choose to hide them in a net<br>
Than amply to imbar their crooked titles<br>
Usurp'd from you and your progenitors.
