      <div class="monologue_preview">
          There be some sports are painful, and their labour<br>
Delight in them sets off: some kinds of baseness<br>
Are nobly undergone and most poor matters <br>
Point to rich ends. This my mean task<br>
Would be as heavy to me as odious, but<br>
The mistress which I serve quickens what's dead<br>
And makes my labours pleasures: O, she is<br>
Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed,<br>
And he's composed of harshness. I must remove<br>
Some thousands of these logs and pile them up,<br>
Upon a sore injunction: my sweet mistress<br>
Weeps when she sees me work, and says, such baseness<br>
Had never like executor. I forget: <br>
But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours,<br>
Most busy lest, when I do it. <br>
