          Now all the youth of England are on fire,<br>
And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies: <br>
Now thrive the armourers, and honour's thought<br>
Reigns solely in the breast of every man:<br>
They sell the pasture now to buy the horse,<br>
Following the mirror of all Christian kings,<br>
With winged heels, as English Mercuries. <br>
For now sits Expectation in the air,<br>
And hides a sword from hilts unto the point<br>
With crowns imperial, crowns and coronets,<br>
Promised to Harry and his followers.<br>
The French, advised by good intelligence <br>
Of this most dreadful preparation,<br>
Shake in their fear and with pale policy<br>
Seek to divert the English purposes.<br>
O England! model to thy inward greatness,<br>
Like little body with a mighty heart, <br>
What mightst thou do, that honour would thee do,<br>
Were all thy children kind and natural!<br>
But see thy fault! France hath in thee found out<br>
A nest of hollow bosoms, which he fills<br>
With treacherous crowns; and three corrupted men, <br>
One, Richard Earl of Cambridge, and the second,<br>
Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, and the third,<br>
Sir Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland,<br>
Have, for the gilt of France,â€”O guilt indeed!<br>
Confirm'd conspiracy with fearful France; <br>
And by their hands this grace of kings must die,<br>
If hell and treason hold their promises,<br>
Ere he take ship for France, and in Southampton.<br>
Linger your patience on; and we'll digest<br>
The abuse of distance; force a play: <br>
The sum is paid; the traitors are agreed;<br>
The king is set from London; and the scene<br>
Is now transported, gentles, to Southampton;<br>
There is the playhouse now, there must you sit:<br>
And thence to France shall we convey you safe, <br>
And bring you back, charming the narrow seas<br>
To give you gentle pass; for, if we may,<br>
We'll not offend one stomach with our play.<br>
But, till the king come forth, and not till then,<br>
Unto Southampton do we shift our scene.
