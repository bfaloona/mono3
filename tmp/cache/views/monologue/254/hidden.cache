      <div class="monologue_preview">
          Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,<br>
Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagoner<br>
As Phaethon would whip you to the west,<br>
And bring in cloudy night immediately.<br>
Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,<br>
That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo<br>
Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.<br>
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites<br>
By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,<br>
It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,<br>
Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,<br>
And learn me how to lose a winning match,<br>
Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:<br>
Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,<br>
With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,<br>
Think true love acted simple modesty.<br>
Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;<br>
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night<br>
Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.<br>
Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,<br>
Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,<br>
Take him and cut him out in little stars, <br>
And he will make the face of heaven so fine<br>
That all the world will be in love with night<br>
And pay no worship to the garish sun.<br>
O, I have bought the mansion of a love,<br>
But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,<br>
Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day<br>
As is the night before some festival<br>
To an impatient child that hath new robes<br>
And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,<br>
And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks<br>
But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
