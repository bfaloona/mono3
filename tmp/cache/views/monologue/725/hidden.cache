          In brief, to set the needless process by,<br>
How I persuaded, how I pray'd, and kneel'd,<br>
How he refell'd me, and how I replied,—<br>
For this was of much length,—the vile conclusion<br>
I now begin with grief and shame to utter:<br>
He would not, but by gift of my chaste body<br>
To his concupiscible intemperate lust,<br>
Release my brother; and, after much debatement,<br>
My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,<br>
And I did yield to him: but the next morn betimes,<br>
His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant<br>
For my poor brother's head. <br>
