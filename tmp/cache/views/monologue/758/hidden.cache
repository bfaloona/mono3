          O Eglamour, thou art a gentlemanâ€”<br>
Think not I flatter, for I swear I do notâ€”<br>
Valiant, wise, remorseful, well accomplish'd:<br>
Thou art not ignorant what dear good will<br>
I bear unto the banish'd Valentine,<br>
Nor how my father would enforce me marry<br>
Vain Thurio, whom my very soul abhors. <br>
Thyself hast loved; and I have heard thee say<br>
No grief did ever come so near thy heart<br>
As when thy lady and thy true love died,<br>
Upon whose grave thou vow'dst pure chastity.<br>
Sir Eglamour, I would to Valentine, <br>
To Mantua, where I hear he makes abode;<br>
And, for the ways are dangerous to pass,<br>
I do desire thy worthy company,<br>
Upon whose faith and honour I repose.<br>
Urge not my father's anger, Eglamour, <br>
But think upon my grief, a lady's grief,<br>
And on the justice of my flying hence,<br>
To keep me from a most unholy match,<br>
Which heaven and fortune still rewards with plagues.<br>
I do desire thee, even from a heart <br>
As full of sorrows as the sea of sands,<br>
To bear me company and go with me:<br>
If not, to hide what I have said to thee,<br>
That I may venture to depart alone.
