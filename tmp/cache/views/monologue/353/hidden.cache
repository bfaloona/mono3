          <b>Prospero.</b> My brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonioâ€” <br>
 I pray thee, mark meâ€”that a brother should<br>
 Be so perfidious!â€”he whom next thyself<br>
 Of all the world I loved and to him put<br>
 The manage of my state; as at that time<br>
 Through all the signories it was the first <br>
 And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed<br>
 In dignity, and for the liberal arts<br>
 Without a parallel; those being all my study,<br>
 The government I cast upon my brother<br>
 And to my state grew stranger, being transported <br>
 And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncleâ€”<br>
 Dost thou attend me? <br>
<br>
<del><b>Miranda.</b> Sir, most heedfully.</del> <br>
<br>
<b>Prospero.</b> Being once perfected how to grant suits,<br>
 How to deny them, who to advance and who <br>
 To trash for over-topping, new created<br>
 The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed 'em,<br>
 Or else new form'd 'em; having both the key<br>
 Of officer and office, set all hearts i' the state<br>
 To what tune pleased his ear; that now he was<br>
 The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,<br>
 And suck'd my verdure out on't. Thou attend'st not. <br>
<br>
<del><b>Miranda.</b> O, good sir, I do.</del> <br>
<br>
<b>Prospero.</b> I pray thee, mark me.<br>
 I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated <br>
 To closeness and the bettering of my mind<br>
 With that which, but by being so retired,<br>
 O'er-prized all popular rate, in my false brother<br>
 Awaked an evil nature; and my trust,<br>
 Like a good parent, did beget of him <br>
 A falsehood in its contrary as great<br>
 As my trust was; which had indeed no limit,<br>
 A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,<br>
 Not only with what my revenue yielded,<br>
 But what my power might else exact, like one <br>
 Who having into truth, by telling of it,<br>
 Made such a sinner of his memory,<br>
 To credit his own lie, he did believe<br>
 He was indeed the duke; out o' the substitution<br>
 And executing the outward face of royalty, <br>
 With all prerogative: hence his ambition growingâ€”<br>
 Dost thou hear? <br>
<br>
 * Miranda. Your tale, sir, would cure deafness. <br>
<br>
 * Prospero. To have no screen between this part he play'd<br>
 And him he play'd it for, he needs will be <br>
 Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library<br>
 Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties<br>
 He thinks me now incapable; confederatesâ€”<br>
 So dry he was for swayâ€”wi' the King of Naples<br>
 To give him annual tribute, do him homage, <br>
 Subject his coronet to his crown and bend<br>
 The dukedom yet unbow'dâ€”alas, poor Milan!â€”<br>
 To most ignoble stooping.
