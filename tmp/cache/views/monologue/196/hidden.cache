          Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own<br>
That, being a stranger in this city here,<br>
Do make myself a suitor to your daughter, <br>
Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous.<br>
Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me<br>
In the preferment of the eldest sister.<br>
This liberty is all that I request-<br>
That, upon knowledge of my parentage, <br>
I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo,<br>
And free access and favour as the rest.<br>
And toward the education of your daughters<br>
I here bestow a simple instrument,<br>
And this small packet of Greek and Latin books.<br>
If you accept them, then their worth is great.
