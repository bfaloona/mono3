          I will be brief, for my short date of breath<br>
Is not so long as is a tedious tale. <br>
Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;<br>
And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:<br>
I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day<br>
Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death<br>
Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city, <br>
For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.<br>
You, to remove that siege of grief from her,<br>
Betroth'd and would have married her perforce<br>
To County Paris: then comes she to me,<br>
And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean<br>
To rid her from this second marriage,<br>
Or in my cell there would she kill herself.<br>
Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,<br>
A sleeping potion; which so took effect<br>
As I intended, for it wrought on her <br>
The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,<br>
That he should hither come as this dire night,<br>
To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,<br>
Being the time the potion's force should cease.<br>
But he which bore my letter, Friar John, <br>
Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight<br>
Return'd my letter back. Then all alone<br>
At the prefixed hour of her waking,<br>
Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;<br>
Meaning to keep her closely at my cell, <br>
Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:<br>
But when I came, some minute ere the time<br>
Of her awaking, here untimely lay<br>
The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.<br>
She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,<br>
And bear this work of heaven with patience:<br>
But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;<br>
And she, too desperate, would not go with me,<br>
But, as it seems, did violence on herself.<br>
All this I know; and to the marriage <br>
Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this<br>
Miscarried by my fault, let my old life<br>
Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,<br>
Unto the rigour of severest law.
