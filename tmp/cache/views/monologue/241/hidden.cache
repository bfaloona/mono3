          <b>Domitius Enobarus.</b> I will tell you.<br>
      The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,<br>
      Burn'd on the water: the poop was beaten gold;<br>
      Purple the sails, and so perfumed that<br>
      The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,<br>
      Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made<br>
      The water which they beat to follow faster,<br>
      As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,<br>
      It beggar'd all description: she did lie<br>
      In her pavilion.cloth-of-gold of tissue.<br>
      O'er-picturing that Venus where we see<br>
      The fancy outwork nature: on each side her<br>
      Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,<br>
      With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem<br>
      To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,<br>
      And what they undid did. <br><br>

<del><b>Agrippa.</b> O, rare for Antony!</del><br><br>

<b>Domitius Enobarus.</b> <br>
Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,<br>
      So many mermaids, tended her i' the eyes,<br>
      And made their bends adornings: at the helm<br>
      A seeming mermaid steers: the silken tackle<br>
      Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands,<br>
      That yarely frame the office. From the barge<br>
      A strange invisible perfume hits the sense<br>
      Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast<br>
      Her people out upon her; and Antony,<br>
      Enthroned i' the market-place, did sit alone,<br>
      Whistling to the air; which, but for vacancy,<br>
      Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,<br>
      And made a gap in nature. <br><br>

<del><b>Agrippa.</b> Rare Egyptian!</del><br><br> 

<b>Domitius Enobarus.</b><br> 
Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,<br>
      Invited her to supper: she replied,<br>
      It should be better he became her guest;<br>
      Which she entreated: our courteous Antony,<br>
      Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak,<br>
      Being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast, <br>
      And for his ordinary pays his heart<br>
      For what his eyes eat only. <br><br>

<del><b>Agrippa.</b> Royal wench!<br>
      She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed:<br>
      He plough'd her, and she cropp'd. <br></del><br><br>

<b>Domitius Enobarus.</b> I saw her once<br>
      Hop forty paces through the public street;<br>
      And having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted,<br>
      That she did make defect perfection,<br>
      And, breathless, power breathe forth. <br><br>

<del><b>Mecaenas.</b> Now Antony must leave her utterly. </del><br><br>

<b>Domitius Enobarus.</b> Never; he will not:<br>
      Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale<br>
      Her infinite variety: other women cloy<br>
      The appetites they feed: but she makes hungry <br>
      Where most she satisfies; for vilest things<br>
      Become themselves in her: that the holy priests<br>
      Bless her when she is riggish.
