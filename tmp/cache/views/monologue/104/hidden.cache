          May it please your Grace, Antipholus, my husband, <br>
Whom I made lord of me and all I had,  <br>
At your important letters, this ill day <br>
A most outrageous fit of madness took him, <br>
That desperately he hurried through the street,.<br>
With him his bondman, all as mad as he,. <br>
Doing displeasure to the citizens <br>
By rushing in their houses, bearing thence<br> 
Rings, jewels, anything his rage did like. <br>
Once did I get him bound and sent him home,  <br>
Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went <br>
That here and there his fury had committed. <br>
Anon, I wot not by what strong escape,<br>
He broke from those that had the guard of him,<br> 
And with his mad attendant and himself, <br>
Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords <br>
Met us again, and, madly bent on us <br>
Chas.d us away, till, raising of more aid<br> 
We came again to bind them. Then they fled <br>
Into this abbey, whither we pursu.d them; <br>
And here the abbess shuts the gates on us,<br>
And will not suffer us to fetch him out, <br>
Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.<br> 
Therefore, most gracious duke, with thy command <br>
Let him be brought forth, and borne hence for help.<br>
  Duke.  Long since thy husband serv.d me in my wars, <br>
And I to thee engag.d a prince.s word,  <br>
When thou didst make him master of thy bed, <br>
To do him all the grace and good I could.<br>
Go, some of you, knock at the abbey gate <br>
And bid the lady abbess come to me.  <br>
I will determine this before I stir.
