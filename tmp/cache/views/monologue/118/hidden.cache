          Why, I must die; <br>
And if I do not by thy hand, thou art <br>
No servant of thy master's. Against self-slaughter<br>
There is a prohibition so divine <br>
That cravens my weak hand. Come, here's my heart.<br> 
Something's afore 't; soft, soft! we'll no defence; <br>
Obedient as the scabbard. What is here?	  <br>
The scriptures of the loyal Leonatus <br>
All turn'd to heresy! Away, away! <br>
Corrupters of my faith; you shall no more <br>
Be stomachers to my heart. Thus may poor fools <br>
Believe false teachers; though those that are betray'd <br>
Do feel the treason sharply, yet the traitor <br>
Stands in worse case of woe.  <br>
And thou, Posthumus, thou that didst set up <br>
My disobedience 'gainst the king my father,   <br>
And make me put into contempt the suits <br>
Of princely fellows, shalt hereafter find <br>
It is no act of common passage, but  <br>
A strain of rareness; and I grieve myself <br>
To think, when thou shalt be disedg'd by her <br>
That now thou tir'st on, how thy memory <br>
Will then be pang'd by me. Prithee, dispatch; <br>
The lamb entreats the butcher; where's thy knife? <br>
Thou art too slow to do thy master's bidding, <br>
When I desire it too.<br>
