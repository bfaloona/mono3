          <b>Titus Andronicus.</b> It was my deer; and he that wounded her<br>
 Hath hurt me more than had he killed me dead:<br>
 For now I stand as one upon a rock<br>
 Environed with a wilderness of sea,<br>
 Who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave, <br>
 Expecting ever when some envious surge<br>
 Will in his brinish bowels swallow him.<br>
 This way to death my wretched sons are gone;<br>
 Here stands my other son, a banished man,<br>
 And here my brother, weeping at my woes. <br>
 But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn,<br>
 Is dear Lavinia, dearer than my soul.<br>
 Had I but seen thy picture in this plight,<br>
 It would have madded me: what shall I do<br>
 Now I behold thy lively body so? <br>
 Thou hast no hands, to wipe away thy tears:<br>
 Nor tongue, to tell me who hath martyr'd thee:<br>
 Thy husband he is dead: and for his death<br>
 Thy brothers are condemn'd, and dead by this.<br>
 Look, Marcus! ah, son Lucius, look on her! <br>
 When I did name her brothers, then fresh tears<br>
 Stood on her cheeks, as doth the honey-dew<br>
 Upon a gather'd lily almost wither'd. <br>
<br>
<del><b>Marcus Andronicus.</b> Perchance she weeps because they kill'd her husband;<br>
 Perchance because she knows them innocent.</del> <br>
<br>
<b>Titus Andronicus.</b> If they did kill thy husband, then be joyful<br>
 Because the law hath ta'en revenge on them.<br>
 No, no, they would not do so foul a deed;<br>
 Witness the sorrow that their sister makes.<br>
 Gentle Lavinia, let me kiss thy lips. <br>
 Or make some sign how I may do thee ease:<br>
 Shall thy good uncle, and thy brother Lucius,<br>
 And thou, and I, sit round about some fountain,<br>
 Looking all downwards to behold our cheeks<br>
 How they are stain'd, as meadows, yet not dry, <br>
 With miry slime left on them by a flood?<br>
 And in the fountain shall we gaze so long<br>
 Till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness,<br>
 And made a brine-pit with our bitter tears?<br>
 Or shall we cut away our hands, like thine? <br>
 Or shall we bite our tongues, and in dumb shows<br>
 Pass the remainder of our hateful days?<br>
 What shall we do? let us, that have our tongues,<br>
 Plot some deuce of further misery,<br>
 To make us wonder'd at in time to come.
