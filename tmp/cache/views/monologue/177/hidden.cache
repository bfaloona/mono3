Sweet soul, let's in, and there expect their coming.<br>
      And yet no matter: why should we go in?<br>
      My friend Stephano, signify, I pray you,<br>
      Within the house, your mistress is at hand; <br>
      And bring your music forth into the air.<br>
      <i>[Exit Stephano]</i><br>
      How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!<br>
      Here will we sit and let the sounds of music<br>
      Creep in our ears: soft stillness and the night <br>
      Become the touches of sweet harmony.<br>
      Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven<br>
      Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold:<br>
      There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st<br>
      But in his motion like an angel sings, <br>
      Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins;<br>
      Such harmony is in immortal souls;<br>
      But whilst this muddy vesture of decay<br>
      Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.<br>
      <i>[Enter Musicians]</i><br>
      Come, ho! and wake Diana with a hymn!<br>
      With sweetest touches pierce your mistress' ear,<br>
      And draw her home with music. <br><br>

<i>[Music]</i><br><br>

<del><b>Jessica.</b> I am never merry when I hear sweet music.</del><br><br>

<b>Lorenzo.</b> 
The reason is, your spirits are attentive:<br>
      For do but note a wild and wanton herd,<br>
      Or race of youthful and unhandled colts,<br>
      Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,<br>
      Which is the hot condition of their blood; <br>
      If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,<br>
      Or any air of music touch their ears,<br>
      You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,<br>
      Their savage eyes turn'd to a modest gaze<br>
      By the sweet power of music: therefore the poet<br>
      Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones and floods;<br>
      Since nought so stockish, hard and full of rage,<br>
      But music for the time doth change his nature.<br>
      The man that hath no music in himself,<br>
      Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,<br>
      Is fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils;<br>
      The motions of his spirit are dull as night<br>
      And his affections dark as Erebus:<br>
      Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.
