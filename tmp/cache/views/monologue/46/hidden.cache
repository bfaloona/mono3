          Lo, she is one of this confederacy!<br>
Now I perceive they have conjoin'd all three<br>
To fashion this false sport, in spite of me.<br>
Injurious Hermia! most ungrateful maid! <br>
Have you conspired, have you with these contrived<br>
To bait me with this foul derision?<br>
Is all the counsel that we two have shared,<br>
The sisters' vows, the hours that we have spent,<br>
When we have chid the hasty-footed time <br>
For parting us,--O, is it all forgot?<br>
All school-days' friendship, childhood innocence?<br>
We, Hermia, like two artificial gods,<br>
Have with our needles created both one flower,<br>
Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion, <br>
Both warbling of one song, both in one key,<br>
As if our hands, our sides, voices and minds,<br>
Had been incorporate. So we grow together,<br>
Like to a double cherry, seeming parted,<br>
But yet an union in partition;<br>
Two lovely berries moulded on one stem;<br>
So, with two seeming bodies, but one heart;<br>
Two of the first, like coats in heraldry,<br>
Due but to one and crowned with one crest.<br>
And will you rent our ancient love asunder, <br>
To join with men in scorning your poor friend?<br>
It is not friendly, 'tis not maidenly:<br>
Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,<br>
Though I alone do feel the injury.
