          My lords, then, under favour, pardon me,<br>
If I speak like a captain. <br>
Why do fond men expose themselves to battle,<br>
And not endure all threats? sleep upon't,<br>
And let the foes quietly cut their throats,<br>
Without repugnancy? If there be<br>
Such valour in the bearing, what make we <br>
Abroad? why then, women are more valiant<br>
That stay at home, if bearing carry it,<br>
And the ass more captain than the lion, the felon<br>
Loaden with irons wiser than the judge,<br>
If wisdom be in suffering. O my lords, <br>
As you are great, be pitifully good:<br>
Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood?<br>
To kill, I grant, is sin's extremest gust;<br>
But, in defence, by mercy, 'tis most just.<br>
To be in anger is impiety; <br>
But who is man that is not angry?<br>
Weigh but the crime with this.
