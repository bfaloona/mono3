          <i>[Reads]</i>
So sweet a kiss the golden sun gives not<br>
To those fresh morning drops upon the rose,<br>
As thy eye-beams, when their fresh rays have smote<br>
The night of dew that on my cheeks down flows:<br>
Nor shines the silver moon one half so bright <br>
Through the transparent bosom of the deep,<br>
As doth thy face through tears of mine give light;<br>
Thou shinest in every tear that I do weep:<br>
No drop but as a coach doth carry thee;<br>
So ridest thou triumphing in my woe. <br>
Do but behold the tears that swell in me,<br>
And they thy glory through my grief will show:<br>
But do not love thyself; then thou wilt keep<br>
My tears for glasses, and still make me weep.<br>
O queen of queens! how far dost thou excel, <br>
No thought can think, nor tongue of mortal tell.<br>
How shall she know my griefs? I'll drop the paper:<br>
Sweet leaves, shade folly. Who is he comes here?<br>
<i>[Steps aside]</i><br>
What, Longaville! and reading! listen, ear.
