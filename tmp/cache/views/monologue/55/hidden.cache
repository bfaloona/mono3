          Thou see'st these lovers seek a place to fight:<br>
Hie therefore, Robin, overcast the night;<br>
The starry welkin cover thou anon<br>
With drooping fog as black as Acheron,<br>
And lead these testy rivals so astray<br>
As one come not within another's way.<br>
Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue,<br>
Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong;<br>
And sometime rail thou like Demetrius;<br>
And from each other look thou lead them thus, <br>
Till o'er their brows death-counterfeiting sleep<br>
With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep:<br>
Then crush this herb into Lysander's eye;<br>
Whose liquor hath this virtuous property,<br>
To take from thence all error with his might,<br>
And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight.<br>
When they next wake, all this derision<br>
Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision,<br>
And back to Athens shall the lovers wend,<br>
With league whose date till death shall never end. <br>
Whiles I in this affair do thee employ,<br>
I'll to my queen and beg her Indian boy;<br>
And then I will her charmed eye release<br>
From monster's view, and all things shall be peace.
