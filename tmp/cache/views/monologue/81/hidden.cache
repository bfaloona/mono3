          What angel shall<br>
Bless this unworthy husband? he cannot thrive,<br> 
Unless her prayers, whom heaven delights to hear, <br>
And loves to grant, reprieve him from the wrath <br>
Of greatest justice. Write, write, Rinaldo,<br> 
To this unworthy husband of his wife;<br> 
Let every word weigh heavy of her worth <br>
That he does weigh too light: my greatest grief,<br>
Though little he do feel it, set down sharply. <br>
Dispatch the most convenient messenger: <br>
When haply he shall hear that she is gone, <br>
He will return; and hope I may that she, <br>
Hearing so much, will speed her foot again, <br>
Led hither by pure love. Which of them both <br> 
Is dearest to me I have no skill in sense <br>
To make distinction. Provide this messenger. <br>
My heart is heavy and mine age is weak; <br>
Grief would have tears, and sorrow bids me speak.
