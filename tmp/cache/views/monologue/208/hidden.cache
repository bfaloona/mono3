          If music be the food of love, play on;<br>
Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting,<br>
The appetite may sicken, and so die.<br>
That strain again! it had a dying fall: <br>
O, it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound,<br>
That breathes upon a bank of violets,<br>
Stealing and giving odour! Enough; no more:<br>
'Tis not so sweet now as it was before.<br>
O spirit of love! how quick and fresh art thou,<br>
That, notwithstanding thy capacity<br>
Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,<br>
Of what validity and pitch soe'er,<br>
But falls into abatement and low price,<br>
Even in a minute: so full of shapes is fancy <br>
That it alone is high fantastical.
