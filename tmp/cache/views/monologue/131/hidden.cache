          Most welcome, bondage! for thou art away,<br>
think, to liberty: yet am I better<br>
Than one that's sick o' the gout; since he had rather<br>
Groan so in perpetuity than be cured<br>
By the sure physician, death, who is the key<br>
To unbar these locks. My conscience, thou art fetter'd <br>
More than my shanks and wrists: you good gods, give me<br>
The penitent instrument to pick that bolt,<br>
Then, free for ever! Is't enough I am sorry?<br>
So children temporal fathers do appease;<br>
Gods are more full of mercy. Must I repent? <br>
I cannot do it better than in gyves,<br>
Desired more than constrain'd: to satisfy,<br>
If of my freedom 'tis the main part, take<br>
No stricter render of me than my all.<br>
I know you are more clement than vile men,<br>
Who of their broken debtors take a third,<br>
A sixth, a tenth, letting them thrive again<br>
On their abatement: that's not my desire:<br>
For Imogen's dear life take mine; and though<br>
'Tis not so dear, yet 'tis a life; you coin'd it:<br>
'Tween man and man they weigh not every stamp;<br>
Though light, take pieces for the figure's sake:<br>
You rather mine, being yours: and so, great powers,<br>
If you will take this audit, take this life,<br>
And cancel these cold bonds. O Imogen! <br>
I'll speak to thee in silence. <br>
