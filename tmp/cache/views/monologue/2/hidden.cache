          O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!<br>
The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,<br>
Th' expectancy and rose of the fair state,<br>
The glass of fashion and the mould of form,<br>
Th' observ'd of all observers- quite, quite down!<br>
And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,<br>
That suck'd the honey of his music vows,<br>
Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,<br>
Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;<br>
That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth<br>
Blasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me<br>
T' have seen what I have seen, see what I see!
