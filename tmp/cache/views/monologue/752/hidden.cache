          In Troy, there lies the scene. From isles of Greece<br>
The princes orgulous, their high blood chafed,<br>
Have to the port of Athens sent their ships,<br>
Fraught with the ministers and instruments<br>
Of cruel war: sixty and nine, that wore<br>
Their crownets regal, from the Athenian bay<br>
Put forth toward Phrygia; and their vow is made<br>
To ransack Troy, within whose strong immures<br>
The ravish'd Helen, Menelaus' queen,<br>
With wanton Paris sleeps; and that's the quarrel.<br>
To Tenedos they come;<br>
And the deep-drawing barks do there disgorge<br>
Their warlike fraughtage: now on Dardan plains<br>
The fresh and yet unbruised Greeks do pitch<br>
Their brave pavilions: Priam's six-gated city,<br>
Dardan, and Tymbria, Helias, Chetas, Troien,<br>
And Antenorides, with massy staples<br>
And corresponsive and fulfilling bolts,<br>
Sperr up the sons of Troy.<br>
Now expectation, tickling skittish spirits,<br>
On one and other side, Trojan and Greek,<br>
Sets all on hazard: and hither am I come<br>
A prologue arm'd, but not in confidence<br>
Of author's pen or actor's voice, but suited<br>
In like conditions as our argument,<br>
To tell you, fair beholders, that our play<br>
Leaps o'er the vaunt and firstlings of those broils,<br>
Beginning in the middle, starting thence away<br>
To what may be digested in a play.<br>
Like or find fault; do as your pleasures are:<br>
Now good or bad, 'tis but the chance of war.
