          Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,<br>
Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:<br>
If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,<br>
Do thou but call my resolution wise,<br>
And with this knife I'll help it presently.<br>
God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;<br>
And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,<br>
Shall be the label to another deed,<br>
Or my true heart with treacherous revolt<br>
Turn to another, this shall slay them both: <br>
Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,<br>
Give me some present counsel, or, behold,<br>
'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife<br>
Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that<br>
Which the commission of thy years and art<br>
Could to no issue of true honour bring.<br>
Be not so long to speak; I long to die,<br>
If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.
