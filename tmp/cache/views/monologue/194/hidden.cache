          Tranio, since for the great desire I had<br>
To see fair Padua, nursery of arts,<br>
I am arriv'd for fruitful Lombardy,<br>
The pleasant garden of great Italy,<br>
And by my father's love and leave am arm'd<br>
With his good will and thy good company,<br>
My trusty servant well approv'd in all, <br>
Here let us breathe, and haply institute<br>
A course of learning and ingenious studies.<br>
Pisa, renowned for grave citizens,<br>
Gave me my being and my father first,<br>
A merchant of great traffic through the world,<br>
Vincentio, come of the Bentivolii;<br>
Vincentio's son, brought up in Florence,<br>
It shall become to serve all hopes conceiv'd,<br>
To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds.<br>
And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study,<br>
Virtue and that part of philosophy<br>
Will I apply that treats of happiness<br>
By virtue specially to be achiev'd.<br>
Tell me thy mind; for I have Pisa left<br>
And am to Padua come as he that leaves <br>
A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep,<br>
And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.
