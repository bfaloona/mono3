Either of condemnation or approof;<br>
Bidding the law make court'sy to their will:<br>
Hooking both right and wrong to the appetite,<br>
To follow as it draws! I'll to my brother:<br>
Though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood,<br>
Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour.<br>
That, had he twenty heads to tender down<br>
On twenty bloody blocks, he'ld yield them up,<br>
Before his sister should her body stoop<br>
To such abhorr'd pollution. <br>
Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die:<br>
More than our brother is our chastity.<br>
I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request,<br>
And fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest. <br>
