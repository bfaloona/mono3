          Think not I love him, though I ask for him.<br>
'Tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well; <br>
But what care I for words? yet words do well, <br>
When he that speaks them pleases those that hear. <br>
It is a pretty youth: not very pretty: <br>
But, sure, he's proud; and yet his pride becomes him:<br> 
He'll make a proper man: the best thing in him <br>
Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue <br>
Did make offence his eye did heal it up.<br>
He is not very tall; yet for his years he's tall:<br> 
His leg is but so so; and yet 'tis well: <br>
There was a pretty redness in his lip, <br>
A little riper and more lusty red <br>
Than that mix'd in his cheek; 'twas just the difference<br> 
Betwixt the constant red and mingled damask.  <br>
There be some women, Silvius, had they mark'd him <br>
In parcels as I did, would have gone near<br>
To fall in love with him; but, for my part, <br>
I love him not nor hate him not; and yet <br>
Have more cause to hate him than to love him: <br>
For what had he to do to chide at me?<br>
He said mine eyes were black and my hair black;<br> 
And, now I am remember'd, scorn'd at me.  <br>
I marvel why I answer'd not again: <br>
But that's all one; omittance is no quittance.<br>
I'll write to him a very taunting letter, <br>
And thou shalt bear it: wilt thou, Silvius?<br>
