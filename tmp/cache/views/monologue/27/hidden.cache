          Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;<br>
And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven,<br>
And so am I reveng'd. That would be scann'd.<br>
A villain kills my father; and for that,<br>
I, his sole son, do this same villain send <br>
To heaven.<br>
Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge!<br>
He took my father grossly, full of bread,<br>
With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;<br>
And how his audit stands, who knows save heaven? <br>
But in our circumstance and course of thought,<br>
'Tis heavy with him; and am I then reveng'd,<br>
To take him in the purging of his soul,<br>
When he is fit and seasoned for his passage?<br>
No. Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent.<br>
When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage;<br>
Or in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed;<br>
At gaming, swearing, or about some act<br>
That has no relish of salvation in't- <br>
Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,<br>
And that his soul may be as damn'd and black<br>
As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays.<br>
This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.<br><br>
