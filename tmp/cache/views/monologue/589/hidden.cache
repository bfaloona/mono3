          He that will give good words to thee will flatter<br>
Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,<br>
That like nor peace nor war? the one affrights you, <br>
The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,<br>
Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;<br>
Where foxes, geese: you are no surer, no,<br>
Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,<br>
Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is <br>
To make him worthy whose offence subdues him<br>
And curse that justice did it. Who deserves greatness<br>
Deserves your hate; and your affections are<br>
A sick man's appetite, who desires most that <br>
Which would increase his evil. He that depends<br>
Upon your favours swims with fins of lead<br>
And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust Ye?<br>
With every minute you do change a mind,<br>
And call him noble that was now your hate, <br>
Him vile that was your garland. What's the matter,<br>
That in these several places of the city<br>
You cry against the noble senate, who,<br>
Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else<br>
Would feed on one another? What's their seeking?
