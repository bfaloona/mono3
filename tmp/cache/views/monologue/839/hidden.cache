          Take her hence:<br>
Her heart is but o'ercharged; she will recover: <br>
I have too much believed mine own suspicion:<br>
Beseech you, tenderly apply to her<br>
Some remedies for life.<br>
[Exeunt PAULINA and Ladies, with HERMIONE]<br>
Apollo, pardon <br>
My great profaneness 'gainst thine oracle!<br>
I'll reconcile me to Polixenes,<br>
New woo my queen, recall the good Camillo,<br>
Whom I proclaim a man of truth, of mercy;<br>
For, being transported by my jealousies <br>
To bloody thoughts and to revenge, I chose<br>
Camillo for the minister to poison<br>
My friend Polixenes: which had been done,<br>
But that the good mind of Camillo tardied<br>
My swift command, though I with death and with <br>
Reward did threaten and encourage him,<br>
Not doing 't and being done: he, most humane<br>
And fill'd with honour, to my kingly guest<br>
Unclasp'd my practise, quit his fortunes here,<br>
Which you knew great, and to the hazard <br>
Of all encertainties himself commended,<br>
No richer than his honour: how he glisters<br>
Thorough my rust! and how his pity<br>
Does my deeds make the blacker!
