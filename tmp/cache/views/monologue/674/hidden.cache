           Let me look back upon thee. O thou wall, 1565<br>
That girdlest in those wolves, dive in the earth,<br>
And fence not Athens! Matrons, turn incontinent!<br>
Obedience fail in children! slaves and fools,<br>
Pluck the grave wrinkled senate from the bench,<br>
And minister in their steads! to general filths 1570<br>
Convert o' the instant, green virginity,<br>
Do 't in your parents' eyes! bankrupts, hold fast;<br>
Rather than render back, out with your knives,<br>
And cut your trusters' throats! bound servants, steal!<br>
Large-handed robbers your grave masters are, <br>
And pill by law. Maid, to thy master's bed;<br>
Thy mistress is o' the brothel! Son of sixteen,<br>
pluck the lined crutch from thy old limping sire,<br>
With it beat out his brains! Piety, and fear,<br>
Religion to the gods, peace, justice, truth, <br>
Domestic awe, night-rest, and neighbourhood,<br>
Instruction, manners, mysteries, and trades,<br>
Degrees, observances, customs, and laws,<br>
Decline to your confounding contraries,<br>
And let confusion live! Plagues, incident to men, <br>
Your potent and infectious fevers heap<br>
On Athens, ripe for stroke! Thou cold sciatica,<br>
Cripple our senators, that their limbs may halt<br>
As lamely as their manners. Lust and liberty<br>
Creep in the minds and marrows of our youth, <br>
That 'gainst the stream of virtue they may strive,<br>
And drown themselves in riot! Itches, blains,<br>
Sow all the Athenian bosoms; and their crop<br>
Be general leprosy! Breath infect breath,<br>
at their society, as their friendship, may <br>
merely poison! Nothing I'll bear from thee,<br>
But nakedness, thou detestable town!<br>
Take thou that too, with multiplying bans!<br>
Timon will to the woods; where he shall find<br>
The unkindest beast more kinder than mankind. <br>
The gods confound—hear me, you good gods all—<br>
The Athenians both within and out that wall!<br>
And grant, as Timon grows, his hate may grow<br>
To the whole race of mankind, high and low! Amen.
