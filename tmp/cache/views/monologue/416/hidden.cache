           'Tis more than time. And, my most noble lord, <br>
I hear for certain, and dare speak the truth:<br>
The gentle Archbishop of York is up<br>
With well-appointed pow'rs. He is a man<br>
Who with a double surety binds his followers.<br>
My lord your son had only but the corpse, <br>
But shadows and the shows of men, to fight;<br>
For that same word 'rebellion' did divide<br>
The action of their bodies from their souls;<br>
And they did fight with queasiness, constrain'd,<br>
As men drink potions; that their weapons only<br>
Seem'd on our side, but for their spirits and souls<br>
This word 'rebellion'â€”it had froze them up,<br>
As fish are in a pond. But now the Bishop<br>
Turns insurrection to religion.<br>
Suppos'd sincere and holy in his thoughts, <br>
He's follow'd both with body and with mind;<br>
And doth enlarge his rising with the blood<br>
Of fair King Richard, scrap'd from Pomfret stones;<br>
Derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause;<br>
Tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land,<br>
Gasping for life under great Bolingbroke;<br>
And more and less do flock to follow him.
