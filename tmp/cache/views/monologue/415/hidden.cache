          Sweet Earl, divorce not wisdom from your honour. <br>
The lives of all your loving complices<br>
Lean on your health; the which, if you give o'er<br>
To stormy passion, must perforce decay.<br>
You cast th' event of war, my noble lord,<br>
And summ'd the account of chance before you said <br>
'Let us make head.' It was your pre-surmise<br>
That in the dole of blows your son might drop.<br>
You knew he walk'd o'er perils on an edge,<br>
More likely to fall in than to get o'er;<br>
You were advis'd his flesh was capable <br>
Of wounds and scars, and that his forward spirit<br>
Would lift him where most trade of danger rang'd;<br>
Yet did you say 'Go forth'; and none of this,<br>
Though strongly apprehended, could restrain<br>
The stiff-borne action. What hath then befall'n, <br>
Or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth<br>
More than that being which was like to be?
