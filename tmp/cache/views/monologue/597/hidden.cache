          You common cry of curs! whose breath I hate<br>
As reek o' the rotten fens, whose loves I prize<br>
As the dead carcasses of unburied men<br>
That do corrupt my air, I banish you;<br>
And here remain with your uncertainty!<br>
Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts!<br>
Your enemies, with nodding of their plumes,<br>
Fan you into despair! Have the power still<br>
To banish your defenders; till at length <br>
Your ignorance, which finds not till it feels,<br>
Making not reservation of yourselves,<br>
Still your own foes, deliver you as most<br>
Abated captives to some nation<br>
That won you without blows! Despising, <br>
For you, the city, thus I turn my back:<br>
There is a world elsewhere.
