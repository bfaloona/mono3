          My gracious lord, that which I would discover<br>
The law of friendship bids me to conceal;<br>
But when I call to mind your gracious favours<br>
Done to me, undeserving as I am, <br>
My duty pricks me on to utter that<br>
Which else no worldly good should draw from me.<br>
Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine, my friend,<br>
This night intends to steal away your daughter:<br>
Myself am one made privy to the plot. <br>
I know you have determined to bestow her<br>
On Thurio, whom your gentle daughter hates;<br>
And should she thus be stol'n away from you,<br>
It would be much vexation to your age.<br>
Thus, for my duty's sake, I rather chose <br>
To cross my friend in his intended drift<br>
Than, by concealing it, heap on your head<br>
A pack of sorrows which would press you down,<br>
Being unprevented, to your timeless grave.
