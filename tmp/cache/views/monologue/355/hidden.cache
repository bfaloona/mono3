          <b>Caliban.</b> I must eat my dinner.<br>
 This island's mine, by Sycorax my mother,<br>
 Which thou takest from me. When thou camest first,<br>
 Thou strokedst me and madest much of me, wouldst give me<br>
 Water with berries in't, and teach me how <br>
 To name the bigger light, and how the less,<br>
 That burn by day and night: and then I loved thee<br>
 And show'd thee all the qualities o' the isle,<br>
 The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile:<br>
 Cursed be I that did so! All the charms <br>
 Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!<br>
 For I am all the subjects that you have,<br>
 Which first was mine own king: and here you sty me<br>
 In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me<br>
 The rest o' the island. <br>
<br>
<del><b>Prospero.</b> Thou most lying slave,<br>
 Whom stripes may move, not kindness! I have used thee,<br>
 Filth as thou art, with human care, and lodged thee<br>
 In mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate<br>
 The honour of my child. </del><br>
<br>
<b>Caliban.</b> O ho, O ho! would't had been done!<br>
 Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled else<br>
 This isle with Calibans. <bR>
