      <div class="monologue_preview">
          I do believe you think what now you speak;<br>
But what we do determine oft we break.<br>
Purpose is but the slave to memory, <br>
Of violent birth, but poor validity;<br>
Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree,<br>
But fall unshaken when they mellow be.<br>
Most necessary 'tis that we forget<br>
To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt.<br>
What to ourselves in passion we propose,<br>
The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.<br>
The violence of either grief or joy<br>
Their own enactures with themselves destroy.<br>
Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament; <br>
Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.<br>
This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange<br>
That even our loves should with our fortunes change;<br>
For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,<br>
Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.<br>
The great man down, you mark his favourite flies,<br>
The poor advanc'd makes friends of enemies;<br>
And hitherto doth love on fortune tend,<br>
For who not needs shall never lack a friend,<br>
And who in want a hollow friend doth try, <br>
Directly seasons him his enemy.<br>
But, orderly to end where I begun,<br>
Our wills and fates do so contrary run<br>
That our devices still are overthrown;<br>
Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.<br>
So think thou wilt no second husband wed;<br>
But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.<br>
