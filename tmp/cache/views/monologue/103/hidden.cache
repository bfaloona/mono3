      <div class="monologue_preview">
          And thereof came it that the man was mad:<br> 
The venom clamours of a jealous woman  <br>
Poison more deadly than a mad dog's tooth. <br>
It seems, his sleeps were hinder'd by thy railing,<br> 
And thereof comes it that his head is light. <br>
Thou say'st his meat was sauc'd with thy up-braidings:<br>
Unquiet meals make ill digestions; <br>
Thereof the raging fire of fever bred: <br>
And what's a fever but a fit of madness? <br>
Thou say'st his sports were hinder'd by thy brawls:<br>
Sweet recreation barr'd, what doth ensue <br>
But moody moping, and dull melancholy, <br>
Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair, <br>
And at her heels a huge infectious troop  <br>
Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?   <br>
In food, in sport, and life-preserving rest  <br>
To be disturb'd, would mad or man or beast:   <br>
The consequence is then, thy jealous fits <br>
Have scar'd thy husband from the use of wits.
