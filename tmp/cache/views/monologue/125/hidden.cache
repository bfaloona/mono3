          Now for our mountain sport. Up to yond hill; <br>
Your legs are young; I'll tread these flats. Consider, <br>
When you above perceive me like a crow,  <br>
That it is place which lessens and sets off; <br>
And you may then revolve what tales I have told you<br> 
Of courts, of princes, of the tricks in war; <br>
This service is not service, so being done,  <br>
But being so allow'd; to apprehend thus <br>
Draws us a profit from all things we see, <br>
And often, to our comfort, shall we find <br>
The sharded beetle in a safer hold  <br>
Than is the full-wing'd eagle. O! this life<br> 
Is nobler than attending for a check, <br>
Richer than doing nothing for a bribe, <br>
Prouder than rustling in unpaid-for silk;  <br>
Such gain the cap of him that makes 'em fine, <br>
Yet keeps his book uncross'd; no life to ours.
