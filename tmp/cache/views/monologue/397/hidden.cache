          Ay, Proteus, but that life is alter'd now:<br>
I have done penance for contemning Love,<br>
Whose high imperious thoughts have punish'd me<br>
With bitter fasts, with penitential groans,<br>
With nightly tears and daily heart-sore sighs;<br>
For in revenge of my contempt of love, <br>
Love hath chased sleep from my enthralled eyes<br>
And made them watchers of mine own heart's sorrow.<br>
O gentle Proteus, Love's a mighty lord,<br>
And hath so humbled me, as, I confess,<br>
There is no woe to his correction, <br>
Nor to his service no such joy on earth.<br>
Now no discourse, except it be of love;<br>
Now can I break my fast, dine, sup and sleep,<br>
Upon the very naked name of love.
