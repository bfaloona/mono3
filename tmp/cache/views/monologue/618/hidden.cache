          You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life<br>
That should be in a Roman you do want,<br>
Or else you use not. You look pale and gaze<br>
And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder,<br>
To see the strange impatience of the heavens:<br>
But if you would consider the true cause<br>
Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,<br>
Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,<br>
Why old men fool and children calculate,<br>
Why all these things change from their ordinance<br>
Their natures and preformed faculties<br>
To monstrous quality,â€”why, you shall find<br>
That heaven hath infused them with these spirits, <br>
To make them instruments of fear and warning<br>
Unto some monstrous state.<br>
Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man<br>
Most like this dreadful night,<br>
That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars <br>
As doth the lion in the Capitol,<br>
A man no mightier than thyself or me<br>
In personal action, yet prodigious grown<br>
And fearful, as these strange eruptions are.
