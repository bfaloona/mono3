          And suddenly; where injury of chance<br>
Puts back leave-taking, justles roughly by<br>
All time of pause, rudely beguiles our lips<br>
Of all rejoindure, forcibly prevents<br>
Our lock'd embrasures, strangles our dear vows<br>
Even in the birth of our own labouring breath:<br>
We two, that with so many thousand sighs<br>
Did buy each other, must poorly sell ourselves <br>
With the rude brevity and discharge of one.<br>
Injurious time now with a robber's haste<br>
Crams his rich thievery up, he knows not how:<br>
As many farewells as be stars in heaven,<br>
With distinct breath and consign'd kisses to them, <br>
He fumbles up into a lose adieu,<br>
And scants us with a single famish'd kiss,<br>
Distasted with the salt of broken tears.
