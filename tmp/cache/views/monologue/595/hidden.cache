          O good but most unwise patricians! why,<br>
You grave but reckless senators, have you thus<br>
Given Hydra here to choose an officer,<br>
That with his peremptory 'shall,' being but<br>
The horn and noise o' the monster's, wants not spirit<br>
To say he'll turn your current in a ditch,<br>
And make your channel his? If he have power<br>
Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake<br>
Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,<br>
Be not as common fools; if you are not, <br>
Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,<br>
If they be senators: and they are no less,<br>
When, both your voices blended, the great'st taste<br>
Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,<br>
And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,' <br>
His popular 'shall' against a graver bench<br>
Than ever frown in Greece. By Jove himself!<br>
It makes the consuls base: and my soul aches<br>
To know, when two authorities are up,<br>
Neither supreme, how soon confusion <br>
May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take<br>
The one by the other.
