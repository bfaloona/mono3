          I do affect the very ground, which is base, where<br>
her shoe, which is baser, guided by her foot, which<br>
is basest, doth tread. I shall be forsworn, which<br>
is a great argument of falsehood, if I love. And<br>
how can that be true love which is falsely<br>
attempted? Love is a familiar; Love is a devil:<br>
there is no evil angel but Love. Yet was Samson so<br>
tempted, and he had an excellent strength; yet was<br>
Solomon so seduced, and he had a very good wit.<br>
Cupid's butt-shaft is too hard for Hercules' club;<br>
and therefore too much odds for a Spaniard's rapier.<br>
The first and second cause will not serve my turn;<br>
the passado he respects not, the duello he regards<br>
not: his disgrace is to be called boy; but his<br>
glory is to subdue men. Adieu, valour! rust rapier!<br>
be still, drum! for your manager is in love; yea,<br>
he loveth. Assist me, some extemporal god of rhyme,<br>
for I am sure I shall turn sonnet. Devise, wit; <br>
write, pen; for I am for whole volumes in folio. <br>
