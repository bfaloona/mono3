          <div align='right'>A time, methinks, too short</div>
To make a world-without-end bargain in.<br>
No, no, my lord, your grace is perjured much,<br>
Full of dear guiltiness; and therefore this:<br>
If for my love, as there is no such cause,<br>
You will do aught, this shall you do for me:<br>
Your oath I will not trust; but go with speed<br>
To some forlorn and naked hermitage,<br>
Remote from all the pleasures of the world;<br>
There stay until the twelve celestial signs<br>
Have brought about the annual reckoning. <br>
If this austere insociable life<br>
Change not your offer made in heat of blood;<br>
If frosts and fasts, hard lodging and thin weeds<br>
Nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love,<br>
But that it bear this trial and last love;<br>
Then, at the expiration of the year,<br>
Come challenge me, challenge me by these deserts,<br>
And, by this virgin palm now kissing thine<br>
I will be thine; and till that instant shut<br>
My woeful self up in a mourning house,<br>
Raining the tears of lamentation<br>
For the remembrance of my father's death.<br>
If this thou do deny, let our hands part,<br>
Neither entitled in the other's heart.
