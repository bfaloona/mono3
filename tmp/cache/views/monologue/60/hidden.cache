          <b>Theseus.</b> Say, what abridgement have you for this evening?<br>
      What masque? what music? How shall we beguile<br>
      The lazy time, if not with some delight? <br><br>

<de><b>Philostrate.</b> There is a brief how many sports are ripe: <br>
      Make choice of which your highness will see first. </del><br><br>

[Giving a paper]<br><br>

<b>Theseus.</b> [Reads] 'The battle with the Centaurs, to be sung<br>
      By an Athenian eunuch to the harp.'<br>
      We'll none of that: that have I told my love,<br>
      In glory of my kinsman Hercules.<br>
      [Reads]<br>
      'The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals,<br>
      Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage.'<br>
      That is an old device; and it was play'd<br>
      When I from Thebes came last a conqueror.<br>
      [Reads]<br>
      'The thrice three Muses mourning for the death<br>
      Of Learning, late deceased in beggary.'<br>
      That is some satire, keen and critical,<br>
      Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony.<br>
      [Reads]<br>
      'A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus<br>
      And his love Thisbe; very tragical mirth.'<br>
      Merry and tragical! tedious and brief!<br>
      That is, hot ice and wondrous strange snow.<br>
      How shall we find the concord of this discord?
