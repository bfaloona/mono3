          My lovely Aaron, wherefore look'st thou sad,<br>
When every thing doth make a gleeful boast?<br>
The birds chant melody on every bush, <br>
The snake lies rolled in the cheerful sun,<br>
The green leaves quiver with the cooling wind<br>
And make a chequer'd shadow on the ground:<br>
Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit,<br>
And, whilst the babbling echo mocks the hounds,<br>
Replying shrilly to the well-tuned horns,<br>
As if a double hunt were heard at once,<br>
Let us sit down and mark their yelping noise;<br>
And, after conflict such as was supposed<br>
The wandering prince and Dido once enjoy'd, <br>
When with a happy storm they were surprised<br>
And curtain'd with a counsel-keeping cave,<br>
We may, each wreathed in the other's arms,<br>
Our pastimes done, possess a golden slumber;<br>
Whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds<br>
Be unto us as is a nurse's song<br>
Of lullaby to bring her babe asleep.
