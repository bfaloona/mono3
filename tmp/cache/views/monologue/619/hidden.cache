          It must be by his death: and for my part,<br>
I know no personal cause to spurn at him,<br>
But for the general. He would be crown'd:<br>
How that might change his nature, there's the question.<br>
It is the bright day that brings forth the adder; <br>
And that craves wary walking. Crown him?—that;—<br>
And then, I grant, we put a sting in him,<br>
That at his will he may do danger with.<br>
The abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins<br>
Remorse from power: and, to speak truth of Caesar, <br>
I have not known when his affections sway'd<br>
More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof,<br>
That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,<br>
Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;<br>
But when he once attains the upmost round. <br>
He then unto the ladder turns his back,<br>
Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees<br>
By which he did ascend. So Caesar may.<br>
Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel<br>
Will bear no colour for the thing he is, <br>
Fashion it thus; that what he is, augmented,<br>
Would run to these and these extremities:<br>
And therefore think him as a serpent's egg<br>
Which, hatch'd, would, as his kind, grow mischievous,<br>
And kill him in the shell.
