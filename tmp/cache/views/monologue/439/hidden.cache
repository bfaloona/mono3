          Therefore doth heaven divide<br>
The state of man in divers functions, <br>
Setting endeavour in continual motion;<br>
To which is fixed, as an aim or butt,<br>
Obedience: for so work the honey-bees,<br>
Creatures that by a rule in nature teach<br>
The act of order to a peopled kingdom.<br>
They have a king and officers of sorts;<br>
Where some, like magistrates, correct at home,<br>
Others, like merchants, venture trade abroad,<br>
Others, like soldiers, armed in their stings,<br>
Make boot upon the summer's velvet buds, <br>
Which pillage they with merry march bring home<br>
To the tent-royal of their emperor;<br>
Who, busied in his majesty, surveys<br>
The singing masons building roofs of gold,<br>
The civil citizens kneading up the honey,<br>
The poor mechanic porters crowding in<br>
Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate,<br>
The sad-eyed justice, with his surly hum,<br>
Delivering o'er to executors pale<br>
The lazy yawning drone. I this infer, <br>
That many things, having full reference<br>
To one consent, may work contrariously:<br>
As many arrows, loosed several ways,<br>
Come to one mark; as many ways meet in one town;<br>
As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea; <br>
As many lines close in the dial's centre;<br>
So may a thousand actions, once afoot.<br>
End in one purpose, and be all well borne<br>
Without defeat. Therefore to France, my liege.<br>
Divide your happy England into four; <br>
Whereof take you one quarter into France,<br>
And you withal shall make all Gallia shake.<br>
If we, with thrice such powers left at home,<br>
Cannot defend our own doors from the dog,<br>
Let us be worried and our nation lose<br>
The name of hardiness and policy.
