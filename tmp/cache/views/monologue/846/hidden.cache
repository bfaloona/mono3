          What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me? <br>
What wheels? racks? fires? what flaying? boiling?<br>
In leads or oils? what old or newer torture<br>
Must I receive, whose every word deserves<br>
To taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny<br>
Together working with thy jealousies, <br>
Fancies too weak for boys, too green and idle<br>
For girls of nine, O, think what they have done<br>
And then run mad indeed, stark mad! for all<br>
Thy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it.<br>
That thou betray'dst Polixenes,'twas nothing; <br>
That did but show thee, of a fool, inconstant<br>
And damnable ingrateful: nor was't much,<br>
Thou wouldst have poison'd good Camillo's honour,<br>
To have him kill a king: poor trespasses,<br>
More monstrous standing by: whereof I reckon <br>
The casting forth to crows thy baby-daughter<br>
To be or none or little; though a devil<br>
Would have shed water out of fire ere done't:<br>
Nor is't directly laid to thee, the death<br>
Of the young prince, whose honourable thoughts, <br>
Thoughts high for one so tender, cleft the heart<br>
That could conceive a gross and foolish sire<br>
Blemish'd his gracious dam: this is not, no,<br>
Laid to thy answer: but the last,â€”O lords,<br>
When I have said, cry 'woe!' the queen, the queen, <br>
The sweet'st, dear'st creature's dead,<br>
and vengeance for't<br>
Not dropp'd down yet.
