          <b>Petruchio.</b> Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench;<br>
      I love her ten times more than e'er I did.<br>
      O, how I long to have some chat with her! <br><br>

<del><b>Baptista Minola.</b> Well, go with me, and be not so discomfited;<br>
      Proceed in practice with my younger daughter;<br>
      She's apt to learn, and thankful for good turns.<br>
      Signior Petruchio, will you go with us, <br>
      Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?<br> </del>

<b>Petruchio.</b> I pray you do.<br> 
<i>[Exeunt all but PETRUCHIO]</i><br>
      I'll attend her here,<br>
      And woo her with some spirit when she comes.<br>
      Say that she rail; why, then I'll tell her plain<br>
      She sings as sweetly as a nightingale.<br>
      Say that she frown; I'll say she looks as clear<br>
      As morning roses newly wash'd with dew.<br>
      Say she be mute, and will not speak a word;<br>
      Then I'll commend her volubility, <br>
      And say she uttereth piercing eloquence.<br>
      If she do bid me pack, I'll give her thanks,<br>
      As though she bid me stay by her a week;<br>
      If she deny to wed, I'll crave the day<br>
      When I shall ask the banns, and when be married.
