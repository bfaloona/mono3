          <b>Hamlet.</b> Get thee to a nunnery! Why wouldst thou be a breeder of
      sinners? I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could accuse 
      me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me.
      I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at my
      beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give
      them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows as I
      do, crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves all;
      believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's your
      father? <br><br>

<del><b>Ophelia.</b> At home, my lord.</del><br><br> 

<b>Hamlet.</b> Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
      nowhere but in's own house. Farewell.<br><br>

<del><b>Ophelia.</b> O, help him, you sweet heavens!</del> <br><br>

<b>Hamlet.</b> If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry:
      be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape
      calumny. Get thee to a nunnery. Go, farewell. Or if thou wilt
      needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what 
      monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too.
      Farewell. <br><br>

<del><b> Ophelia.</b> O heavenly powers, restore him! </del><br><br>

<b>Hamlet.</b> I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath
      given you one face, and you make yourselves another. You jig, you 
      amble, and you lisp; you nickname God's creatures and make your
      wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't! it hath made
      me mad. I say, we will have no moe marriages. Those that are
      married already- all but one- shall live; the rest shall keep as
      they are. To a nunnery, go.<br><br>
