          O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else? <br>
And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!<br>
And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,<br>
But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?<br>
Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat<br>
In this distracted globe. Remember thee? <br>
Yea, from the table of my memory<br>
I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,<br>
All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past<br>
That youth and observation copied there,<br>
And thy commandment all alone shall live <br>
Within the book and volume of my brain,<br>
Unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!<br>
O most pernicious woman!<br>
O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!<br>
My tables! Meet it is I set it down <br>
That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain<br>
At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark. [<i>Writes.</i>]<br>
So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:<br>
It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.'<br>
I have sworn't. <br>
