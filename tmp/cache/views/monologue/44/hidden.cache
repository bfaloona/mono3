          <b>Hermia.</b> Now I but chide; but I should use thee worse,<br>
      If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep,<br>
      Being o'er shoes in blood, plunge in the deep,<br>
      And kill me too.<br>
      The sun was not so true unto the day<br>
      As he to me: would he have stolen away<br>
      From sleeping Hermia? I'll believe as soon<br>
      This whole earth may be bored and that the moon<br>
      May through the centre creep and so displease<br>
      Her brother's noontide with Antipodes.<br>
      It cannot be but thou hast murder'd him;<br>
      So should a murderer look, so dead, so grim. <br><br>

<del><b>Demetrius.</b> So should the murder'd look, and so should I,<br>
      Pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty:<br>
      Yet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear,<br>
      As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere. </del><br><br>

<b>Hermia.</b> What's this to my Lysander? where is he?<br>
      Ah, good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me? <br><br>

<del><b>Demetrius.</b> I had rather give his carcass to my hounds. </del><br><br>

<b>Hermia.</b> Out, dog! out, cur! thou drivest me past the bounds<br>
      Of maiden's patience. Hast thou slain him, then?<br>
      Henceforth be never number'd among men! <br>
      O, once tell true, tell true, even for my sake!<br>
      Durst thou have look'd upon him being awake,<br>
      And hast thou kill'd him sleeping? O brave touch!<br>
      Could not a worm, an adder, do so much?<br>
      An adder did it; for with doubler tongue<br>
      Than thine, thou serpent, never adder stung.
