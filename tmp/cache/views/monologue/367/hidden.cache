          O Pandarus! I tell thee, Pandarus,â€”<br>
When I do tell thee, there my hopes lie drown'd,<br>
Reply not in how many fathoms deep <br>
They lie indrench'd. I tell thee I am mad<br>
In Cressid's love: thou answer'st 'she is fair;'<br>
Pour'st in the open ulcer of my heart<br>
Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice,<br>
Handlest in thy discourse, O, that her hand, <br>
In whose comparison all whites are ink,<br>
Writing their own reproach, to whose soft seizure<br>
The cygnet's down is harsh and spirit of sense<br>
Hard as the palm of ploughman: this thou tell'st me,<br>
As true thou tell'st me, when I say I love her; <br>
But, saying thus, instead of oil and balm,<br>
Thou lay'st in every gash that love hath given me<br>
The knife that made it.
