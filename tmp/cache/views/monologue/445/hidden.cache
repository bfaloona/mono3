      <div class="monologue_preview">
          Thus with imagin'd wing our swift scene flies<br>
In motion of no less celerity<br>
Than that of thought. Suppose that you have seen <br>
The well-appointed king at Hampton pier<br>
Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet<br>
With silken streamers the young Phoebus fanning:<br>
Play with your fancies, and in them behold<br>
Upon the hempen tackle ship-boys climbing; <br>
Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give<br>
To sounds confused; behold the threaden sails,<br>
Borne with the invisible and creeping wind,<br>
Draw the huge bottoms through the furrow'd sea,<br>
Breasting the lofty surge: O, do but think <br>
You stand upon the ravage and behold<br>
A city on the inconstant billows dancing;<br>
For so appears this fleet majestical,<br>
Holding due course to Harfleur. Follow, follow:<br>
Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy, <br>
And leave your England, as dead midnight still,<br>
Guarded with grandsires, babies and old women,<br>
Either past or not arrived to pith and puissance;<br>
For who is he, whose chin is but enrich'd<br>
With one appearing hair, that will not follow<br>
These cull'd and choice-drawn cavaliers to France?<br>
Work, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege;<br>
Behold the ordnance on their carriages,<br>
With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur.<br>
Suppose the ambassador from the French comes back; <br>
Tells Harry that the king doth offer him<br>
Katharine his daughter, and with her, to dowry,<br>
Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms.<br>
The offer likes not: and the nimble gunner<br>
With linstock now the devilish cannon touches, <br>
<i>[Alarum, and chambers go off]</i><br>
And down goes all before them. Still be kind,<br>
And eke out our performance with your mind.
