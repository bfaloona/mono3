          Away! I do condemn mine ears that have <br>
So long attended thee. If thou wert honourable, <br>
Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue, not <br>
For such an end thou seek'st; as base as strange. <br>
Thou wrong'st a gentleman, who is as far <br>
From thy report as thou from honour, and   <br>
Solicit'st here a lady that disdains  <br>
Thee and the devil alike. What ho, Pisanio! <br>
The king my father shall be made acquainted  <br>
Of thy assault; if he shall think it fit, <br>
A saucy stranger in his court to mart <br>
As in a Romish stew and to expound<br>
His beastly mind to us, he hath a court<br> 
He little cares for and a daughter who <br>
He not respects at all. <br>
