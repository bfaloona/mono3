          [<i>with a bloody handkerchief</i>]
<p>
Yea, bloody cloth, I'll keep thee, for I wish'd<br>
      Thou shouldst be colour'd thus. You married ones,<br>
      If each of you should take this course, how many<br>
      Must murder wives much better than themselves<br>
      For wrying but a little! O Pisanio!<br>
      Every good servant does not all commands:<br>
      No bond but to do just ones. Gods! if you<br>
      Should have ta'en vengeance on my faults, I never<br>
      Had lived to put on this: so had you saved<br>
      The noble Imogen to repent, and struck<br>
      Me, wretch more worth your vengeance. But, alack,<br>
      You snatch some hence for little faults; that's love,<br>
      To have them fall no more: you some permit<br>
      To second ills with ills, each elder worse,<br>
      And make them dread it, to the doers' thrift.<br>
      But Imogen is your own: do your best wills,<br>
      And make me blest to obey! I am brought hither<br>
      Among the Italian gentry, and to fight<br>
      Against my lady's kingdom: 'tis enough<br>
      That, Britain, I have kill'd thy mistress; peace!<br>
      I'll give no wound to thee. Therefore, good heavens,<br>
      Hear patiently my purpose: I'll disrobe me<br>
      Of these Italian weeds and suit myself<br>
      As does a Briton peasant: so I'll fight<br>
      Against the part I come with; so I'll die<br>
      For thee, O Imogen, even for whom my life<br>
      Is every breath a death; and thus, unknown,<br>
      Pitied nor hated, to the face of peril<br>
      Myself I'll dedicate. Let me make men know<br>
      More valour in me than my habits show.<br>
      Gods, put the strength o' the Leonati in me!<br>
      To shame the guise o' the world, I will begin<br>
      The fashion, less without and more within. <br>
