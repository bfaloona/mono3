          Upon the king! let us our lives, our souls,<br>
Our debts, our careful wives,<br>
Our children and our sins lay on the king!<br>
We must bear all. O hard condition,<br>
Twin-born with greatness, subject to the breath <br>
Of every fool, whose sense no more can feel<br>
But his own wringing! What infinite heart's-ease<br>
Must kings neglect, that private men enjoy!<br>
And what have kings, that privates have not too,<br>
Save ceremony, save general ceremony? <br>
And what art thou, thou idle ceremony?<br>
What kind of god art thou, that suffer'st more<br>
Of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers?<br>
What are thy rents? what are thy comings in?<br>
O ceremony, show me but thy worth! <br>
What is thy soul of adoration?<br>
Art thou aught else but place, degree and form,<br>
Creating awe and fear in other men?<br>
Wherein thou art less happy being fear'd<br>
Than they in fearing. <br>
What drink'st thou oft, instead of homage sweet,<br>
But poison'd flattery? O, be sick, great greatness,<br>
And bid thy ceremony give thee cure!<br>
Think'st thou the fiery fever will go out<br>
With titles blown from adulation? <br>
Will it give place to flexure and low bending?<br>
Canst thou, when thou command'st the beggar's knee,<br>
Command the health of it? No, thou proud dream,<br>
That play'st so subtly with a king's repose;<br>
I am a king that find thee, and I know <br>
'Tis not the balm, the sceptre and the ball,<br>
The sword, the mace, the crown imperial,<br>
The intertissued robe of gold and pearl,<br>
The farced title running 'fore the king,<br>
The throne he sits on, nor the tide of pomp <br>
That beats upon the high shore of this world,<br>
No, not all these, thrice-gorgeous ceremony,<br>
Not all these, laid in bed majestical,<br>
Can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave,<br>
Who with a body fill'd and vacant mind <br>
Gets him to rest, cramm'd with distressful bread;<br>
Never sees horrid night, the child of hell,<br>
But, like a lackey, from the rise to set<br>
Sweats in the eye of Phoebus and all night<br>
Sleeps in Elysium; next day after dawn,<br>
Doth rise and help Hyperion to his horse,<br>
And follows so the ever-running year,<br>
With profitable labour, to his grave:<br>
And, but for ceremony, such a wretch,<br>
Winding up days with toil and nights with sleep, <br>
Had the fore-hand and vantage of a king.<br>
The slave, a member of the country's peace,<br>
Enjoys it; but in gross brain little wots<br>
What watch the king keeps to maintain the peace,<br>
Whose hours the peasant best advantages.
