          <b>Cassius.</b> <del>Messala,</del><br>
 This is my birth-day; as this very day<br>
 Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala:<br>
 Be thou my witness that against my will,<br>
 As Pompey was, am I compell'd to set<br>
 Upon one battle all our liberties.<br>
 You know that I held Epicurus strong<br>
 And his opinion: now I change my mind,<br>
 And partly credit things that do presage.<br>
 Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign<br>
 Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch'd,<br>
 Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands;<br>
 Who to Philippi here consorted us:<br>
 This morning are they fled away and gone;<br>
 And in their steads do ravens, crows and kites,<br>
 Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us,<br>
 As we were sickly prey: their shadows seem<br>
 A canopy most fatal, under which<br>
 Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.<br>
<br>
<del><b>Messala.</b> Believe not so.<br>
<br>
<b>Cassius.</b>I but believe it partly;<br>
 For I am fresh of spirit and resolved<br>
 To meet all perils very constantly. <br>
<br>
<b>Brutus.</b> Even so, Lucilius. </del><br>
<br>
<b>Cassius.</b> Now, most noble Brutus,<br>
 The gods to-day stand friendly, that we may,<br>
 Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age!<br>
 But since the affairs of men rest still incertain,<br>
 Let's reason with the worst that may befall. <br>
 If we do lose this battle, then is this<br>
 The very last time we shall speak together:<br>
 What are you then determined to do?
