          Why, lords, what wrongs are these! was ever seen <br>
An emperor in Rome thus overborne,<br>
Troubled, confronted thus; and, for the extent<br>
Of egal justice, used in such contempt?<br>
My lords, you know, as know the mightful gods,<br>
However these disturbers of our peace <br>
Buz in the people's ears, there nought hath pass'd,<br>
But even with law, against the willful sons<br>
Of old Andronicus. And what an if<br>
His sorrows have so overwhelm'd his wits,<br>
Shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks, <br>
His fits, his frenzy, and his bitterness?<br>
And now he writes to heaven for his redress:<br>
See, here's to Jove, and this to Mercury;<br>
This to Apollo; this to the god of war;<br>
Sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Rome! <br>
What's this but libelling against the senate,<br>
And blazoning our injustice every where?<br>
A goodly humour, is it not, my lords?<br>
As who would say, in Rome no justice were.<br>
But if I live, his feigned ecstasies <br>
Shall be no shelter to these outrages:<br>
But he and his shall know that justice lives<br>
In Saturninus' health, whom, if she sleep,<br>
He'll so awake as she in fury shall<br>
Cut off the proud'st conspirator that lives.
