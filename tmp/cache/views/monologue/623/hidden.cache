          <del>I doubt not of your wisdom. <br>
Let each man render me his bloody hand:<br>
First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you;<br>
Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand;<br>
Now, Decius Brutus, yours: now yours, Metellus;<br>
Yours, Cinna; and, my valiant Casca, yours; <br>
Though last, not last in love, yours, good Trebonius.<br>
Gentlemen all,â€”alas, what shall I say?<br></del>
My credit now stands on such slippery ground,<br>
That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,<br>
Either a coward or a flatterer. <br>
That I did love thee, Caesar, O, 'tis true:<br>
If then thy spirit look upon us now,<br>
Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death,<br>
To see thy thy Anthony making his peace,<br>
Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes, <br>
Most noble! in the presence of thy corse?<br>
Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,<br>
Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,<br>
It would become me better than to close<br>
In terms of friendship with thine enemies. <br>
Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bay'd, brave hart;<br>
Here didst thou fall; and here thy hunters stand,<br>
Sign'd in thy spoil, and crimson'd in thy lethe.<br>
O world, thou wast the forest to this hart;<br>
And this, indeed, O world, the heart of thee. <br>
How like a deer, strucken by many princes,<br>
Dost thou here lie!
