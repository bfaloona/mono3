          [Reads the epitaph] 'Here lies a <br>
wretched corse, of wretched soul bereft:<br>
Seek not my name: a plague consume you wicked caitiffs left!<br>
Here lie I, Timon; who, alive, all living men did hate:<br>
Pass by and curse thy fill, but pass and stay not here thy gait.'<br>
These well express in thee thy latter spirits:<br>
Though thou abhorr'dst in us our human griefs,<br>
Scorn'dst our brain's flow and those our droplets which <br>
From niggard nature fall, yet rich conceit<br>
Taught thee to make vast Neptune weep for aye<br>
On thy low grave, on faults forgiven. <br>
Dead Is noble Timon: of whose memory<br>
Hereafter more. Bring me into your city, <br>
And I will use the olive with my sword,<br>
Make war breed peace, make peace stint war, make each<br>
Prescribe to other as each other's leech.<br>
Let our drums strike.
