      <div class="monologue_preview">
          Troy, yet upon his basis, had been down,<br>
And the great Hector's sword had lack'd a master,<br>
But for these instances. <br>
The specialty of rule hath been neglected:<br>
And, look, how many Grecian tents do stand<br>
Hollow upon this plain, so many hollow factions.<br>
When that the general is not like the hive<br>
To whom the foragers shall all repair, <br>
What honey is expected? Degree being vizarded,<br>
The unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask.<br>
The heavens themselves, the planets and this centre<br>
Observe degree, priority and place,<br>
Insisture, course, proportion, season, form,<br>
Office and custom, in all line of order;<br>
And therefore is the glorious planet Sol<br>
In noble eminence enthroned and sphered<br>
Amidst the other; whose medicinable eye<br>
Corrects the ill aspects of planets evil, <br>
And posts, like the commandment of a king,<br>
Sans cheque to good and bad: but when the planets<br>
In evil mixture to disorder wander,<br>
What plagues and what portents! what mutiny!<br>
What raging of the sea! shaking of earth! <br>
Commotion in the winds! frights, changes, horrors,<br>
Divert and crack, rend and deracinate<br>
The unity and married calm of states<br>
Quite from their fixure! O, when degree is shaked,<br>
Which is the ladder to all high designs, <br>
Then enterprise is sick! How could communities,<br>
Degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities,<br>
Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,<br>
The primogenitive and due of birth,<br>
Prerogative of age, crowns, sceptres, laurels, <br>
But by degree, stand in authentic place?<br>
Take but degree away, untune that string,<br>
And, hark, what discord follows! each thing meets<br>
In mere oppugnancy: the bounded waters<br>
Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores <br>
And make a sop of all this solid globe:<br>
Strength should be lord of imbecility,<br>
And the rude son should strike his father dead:<br>
Force should be right; or rather, right and wrong,<br>
Between whose endless jar justice resides, <br>
Should lose their names, and so should justice too.<br>
Then every thing includes itself in power,<br>
Power into will, will into appetite;<br>
And appetite, an universal wolf,<br>
So doubly seconded with will and power, <br>
Must make perforce an universal prey,<br>
And last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon,<br>
This chaos, when degree is suffocate,<br>
Follows the choking.<br>
And this neglection of degree it is <br>
That by a pace goes backward, with a purpose<br>
It hath to climb. The general's disdain'd<br>
By him one step below, he by the next,<br>
That next by him beneath; so every step,<br>
Exampled by the first pace that is sick <br>
Of his superior, grows to an envious fever<br>
Of pale and bloodless emulation:<br>
And 'tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot,<br>
Not her own sinews. To end a tale of length,<br>
Troy in our weakness stands, not in her strength.
