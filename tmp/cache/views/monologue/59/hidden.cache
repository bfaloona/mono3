          More strange than true: I never may believe<br>
These antique fables, nor these fairy toys.<br>
Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,<br>
Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend <br>
More than cool reason ever comprehends.<br>
The lunatic, the lover and the poet<br>
Are of imagination all compact:<br>
One sees more devils than vast hell can hold,<br>
That is, the madman: the lover, all as frantic, <br>
Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt:<br>
The poet's eye, in fine frenzy rolling,<br>
Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;<br>
And as imagination bodies forth<br>
The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen<br>
Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing<br>
A local habitation and a name.<br>
Such tricks hath strong imagination,<br>
That if it would but apprehend some joy,<br>
It comprehends some bringer of that joy;<br>
Or in the night, imagining some fear,<br>
How easy is a bush supposed a bear!
