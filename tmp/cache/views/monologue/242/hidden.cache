          I have done enough; a lower place, note well,<br>
May make too great an act: for learn this, Silius;<br>
Better to leave undone, than by our deed<br>
Acquire too high a fame when him we serve's away.<br>
Caesar and Antony have ever won<br>
More in their officer than person: Sossius,<br>
One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant,<br>
For quick accumulation of renown,<br>
Which he achieved by the minute, lost his favour.<br>
Who does i' the wars more than his captain can<br>
Becomes his captain's captain: and ambition,<br>
The soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss,<br>
Than gain which darkens him.<br>
I could do more to do Antonius good,<br>
But 'twould offend him; and in his offence<br>
Should my performance perish.
