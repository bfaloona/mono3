          <b>Isabella.</b> Most strange, but yet most truly, will I speak:<br>
 That Angelo's forsworn; is it not strange?<br>
 That Angelo's a murderer; is 't not strange?<br>
 That Angelo is an adulterous thief, <br>
 An hypocrite, a virgin-violator;<br>
 Is it not strange and strange? <br>
<br>
<del><b>Vincentio.</b> Nay, it is ten times strange. </del><br>
<br>
<b>Isabella.</b> It is not truer he is Angelo<br>
 Than this is all as true as it is strange: <br>
 Nay, it is ten times true; for truth is truth<br>
 To the end of reckoning. <br>
<br>
<del><b>Vincentio.</b> Away with her! Poor soul,<br>
 She speaks this in the infirmity of sense. </del><br>
<br>
<B>Isabella.</b> O prince, I conjure thee, as thou believest <br>
 There is another comfort than this world,<br>
 That thou neglect me not, with that opinion<br>
 That I am touch'd with madness! Make not impossible<br>
 That which but seems unlike: 'tis not impossible<br>
 But one, the wicked'st caitiff on the ground, <br>
 May seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute<br>
 As Angelo; even so may Angelo,<br>
 In all his dressings, characts, titles, forms,<br>
 Be an arch-villain; believe it, royal prince:<br>
 If he be less, he's nothing; but he's more,<br>
 Had I more name for badness. <br>
