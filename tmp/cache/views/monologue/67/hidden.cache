          <div align='right'>The raven himself is hoarse</div>
That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan<br>
Under my battlements. Come, you spirits <br>
That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,<br>
And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full<br>
Of direst cruelty! make thick my blood;<br>
Stop up the access and passage to remorse,<br>
That no compunctious visitings of nature<br>
Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between<br>
The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts,<br>
And take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers,<br>
Wherever in your sightless substances<br>
You wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night,<br>
And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,<br>
That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,<br>
Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark,<br>
To cry 'Hold, hold!'
