          Be absolute for death; either death or life<br>
Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life:<br>
If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing<br>
That none but fools would keep: a breath thou art, <br>
Servile to all the skyey influences,<br>
That dost this habitation, where thou keep'st,<br>
Hourly afflict: merely, thou art death's fool;<br>
For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun<br>
And yet runn'st toward him still. Thou art not noble;<br>
For all the accommodations that thou bear'st<br>
Are nursed by baseness. Thou'rt by no means valiant;<br>
For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork<br>
Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,<br>
And that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear'st <br>
Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;<br>
For thou exist'st on many a thousand grains<br>
That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;<br>
For what thou hast not, still thou strivest to get,<br>
And what thou hast, forget'st. Thou art not certain;<br>
For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,<br>
After the moon. If thou art rich, thou'rt poor;<br>
For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,<br>
Thou bear's thy heavy riches but a journey,<br>
And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none; <br>
For thine own bowels, which do call thee sire,<br>
The mere effusion of thy proper loins,<br>
Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,<br>
For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,<br>
But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep, <br>
Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth<br>
Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms<br>
Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,<br>
Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,<br>
To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in this <br>
That bears the name of life? Yet in this life<br>
Lie hid moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear,<br>
That makes these odds all even. <br>
