          Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death<br>
The memory be green, and that it us befitted<br>
To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom<br>
To be contracted in one brow of woe,<br>
Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature<br>
That we with wisest sorrow think on him<br>
Together with remembrance of ourselves.<br>
Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,<br>
Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,<br>
Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy, <br>
With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,<br>
With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,<br>
In equal scale weighing delight and dole,<br>
Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd<br>
Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone <br>
With this affair along. For all, our thanks.<br>
Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,<br>
Holding a weak supposal of our worth,<br>
Or thinking by our late dear brother's death<br>
Our state to be disjoint and out of frame, <br>
Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,<br>
He hath not fail'd to pester us with message<br>
Importing the surrender of those lands<br>
Lost by his father, with all bands of law,<br>
To our most valiant brother. So much for him. <br>
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.<br>
Thus much the business is: we have here writ<br>
To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,<br>
Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears<br>
Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress <br>
His further gait herein, in that the levies,<br>
The lists, and full proportions are all made<br>
Out of his subject; and we here dispatch<br>
You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,<br>
For bearers of this greeting to old Norway, <br>
Giving to you no further personal power<br>
To business with the King, more than the scope<br>
Of These dilated articles allow. [<i>Gives a paper.</i>]
Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty. <br>
