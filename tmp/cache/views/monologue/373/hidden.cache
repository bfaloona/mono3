          Yes, 'tis most meet: whom may you else oppose,<br>
That can from Hector bring his honour off,<br>
If not Achilles? Though't be a sportful combat,<br>
Yet in the trial much opinion dwells;<br>
For here the Trojans taste our dear'st repute <br>
With their finest palate: and trust to me, Ulysses,<br>
Our imputation shall be oddly poised<br>
In this wild action; for the success,<br>
Although particular, shall give a scantling<br>
Of good or bad unto the general; <br>
And in such indexes, although small pricks<br>
To their subsequent volumes, there is seen<br>
The baby figure of the giant mass<br>
Of things to come at large. It is supposed<br>
He that meets Hector issues from our choice <br>
And choice, being mutual act of all our souls,<br>
Makes merit her election, and doth boil,<br>
As 'twere from us all, a man distill'd<br>
Out of our virtues; who miscarrying,<br>
What heart receives from hence the conquering part, <br>
To steel a strong opinion to themselves?<br>
Which entertain'd, limbs are his instruments,<br>
In no less working than are swords and bows<br>
Directive by the limbs.
