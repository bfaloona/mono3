          <div align='right'>Macduff, this noble passion,</div>
Child of integrity, hath from my soul<br>
Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts<br>
To thy good truth and honour. Devilish Macbeth<br>
By many of these trains hath sought to win me<br>
Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me<br>
From over-credulous haste: but God above<br>
Deal between thee and me! for even now <br>
I put myself to thy direction, and<br>
Unspeak mine own detraction, here abjure<br>
The taints and blames I laid upon myself,<br>
For strangers to my nature. I am yet<br>
Unknown to woman, never was forsworn, <br>
Scarcely have coveted what was mine own,<br>
At no time broke my faith, would not betray<br>
The devil to his fellow and delight<br>
No less in truth than life: my first false speaking<br>
Was this upon myself: what I am truly, <br>
Is thine and my poor country's to command:<br>
Whither indeed, before thy here-approach,<br>
Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men,<br>
Already at a point, was setting forth.<br>
Now we'll together; and the chance of goodness <br>
Be like our warranted quarrel!
