          Yes, if this present quality of war-<br>
Indeed the instant action, a cause on foot-<br>
Lives so in hope, as in an early spring<br>
We see th' appearing buds; which to prove fruit<br>
Hope gives not so much warrant, as despair 645<br>
That frosts will bite them. When we mean to build,<br>
We first survey the plot, then draw the model;<br>
And when we see the figure of the house,<br>
Then we must rate the cost of the erection;<br>
Which if we find outweighs ability,<br>
What do we then but draw anew the model<br>
In fewer offices, or at least desist<br>
To build at all? Much more, in this great work—<br>
Which is almost to pluck a kingdom down<br>
And set another up—should we survey<br>
The plot of situation and the model,<br>
Consent upon a sure foundation,<br>
Question surveyors, know our own estate<br>
How able such a work to undergo-<br>
To weigh against his opposite; or else <br>
We fortify in paper and in figures,<br>
Using the names of men instead of men;<br>
Like one that draws the model of a house<br>
Beyond his power to build it; who, half through,<br>
Gives o'er and leaves his part-created cost<br>
A naked subject to the weeping clouds<br>
And waste for churlish winter's tyranny.
