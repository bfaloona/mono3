Now I perceive that she hath made compare<br>
Between our statures; she hath urged her height;<br>
And with her personage, her tall personage, <br>
Her height, forsooth, she hath prevail'd with him.<br>
And are you grown so high in his esteem;<br>
Because I am so dwarfish and so low?<br>
How low am I, thou painted maypole? speak;<br>
How low am I? I am not yet so low <br>
But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.
