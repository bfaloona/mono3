          Be patient, gentlemen. I choose her for myself;<br>
If she and I be pleas'd, what's that to you?<br>
'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain, being alone, <br>
That she shall still be curst in company.<br>
I tell you 'tis incredible to believe.<br>
How much she loves me- O, the kindest Kate!<br>
She hung about my neck, and kiss on kiss<br>
She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath,<br>
That in a twink she won me to her love.<br>
O, you are novices! 'Tis a world to see,<br>
How tame, when men and women are alone,<br>
A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.<br>
Give me thy hand, Kate; I will unto Venice,<br>
To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding-day.<br>
Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests;<br>
I will be sure my Katherine shall be fine.
