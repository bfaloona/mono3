      <div class="monologue_preview">
          How all occasions do inform against me<br>
And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,<br>
If his chief good and market of his time<br>
Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.<br>
Sure he that made us with such large discourse,<br>
Looking before and after, gave us not<br>
That capability and godlike reason<br>
To fust in us unus'd. Now, whether it be<br>
Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple<br>
Of thinking too precisely on th' event,- <br>
A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom<br>
And ever three parts coward,- I do not know<br>
Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do,'<br>
Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means<br>
To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me. <br>
Witness this army of such mass and charge,<br>
Led by a delicate and tender prince,<br>
Whose spirit, with divine ambition puff'd,<br>
Makes mouths at the invisible event,<br>
Exposing what is mortal and unsure <br>
To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,<br>
Even for an eggshell. Rightly to be great<br>
Is not to stir without great argument,<br>
But greatly to find quarrel in a straw<br>
When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,<br>
That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,<br>
Excitements of my reason and my blood,<br>
And let all sleep, while to my shame I see<br>
The imminent death of twenty thousand men<br>
That for a fantasy and trick of fame <br>
Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot<br>
Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,<br>
Which is not tomb enough and continent<br>
To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,<br>
My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth! <br><br>
