      <div class="monologue_preview">
          And why, I pray you? Who might be your mother,<br>
That you insult, exult, and all at once, <br>
Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty,-- <br>
As by my faith, I see no more in you <br>
Than without candle may go dark to bed,--<br>
Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?  <br>
Why, what means this? Why do you look on me? <br>
I see no more in you than in the ordinary <br>
Of nature's sale-work. Od's my little life!<br>
I think she means to tangle my eyes too. <br>
No, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it: <br>
'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair, <br>
Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,<br>
That can entame my spirits to your worship. <br>
You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,<br> 
Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain? <br>
You are a thousand times a properer man <br>
Than she a woman: 'tis such fools as you  <br>
That make the world full of ill-favour'd children:<br> 
'Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her; <br>
And out of you she sees herself more proper<br>
Than any of her lineaments can show her. <br>
But, mistress, know yourself: down on your knees,<br> 
And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love:  <br>
For I must tell you friendly in your ear, <br>
Sell when you can; you are not for all markets.<br> 
Cry the man mercy; love him; take his offer: <br>
Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer. <br>
So take her to thee, shepherd. Fare you well.<br>
