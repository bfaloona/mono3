          Call you me fair? that fair again unsay..<br>
Demetrius loves your fair: O happy fair! <br>
Your eyes are lode-stars; and your tongue's sweet air<br>
More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear,<br>
When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.<br>
Sickness is catching: O, were favour so,<br>
Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go; <br>
My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,<br>
My tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody.<br>
Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,<br>
The rest I'd give to be to you translated.<br>
O, teach me how you look, and with what art <br>
You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart.
