            Soft you; a word or two before you go. <br>
      I have done the state some service, and they know't.<br>
      No more of that. I pray you, in your letters,<br>
      When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,<br>
      Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate,<br>
      Nor set down aught in malice: then must you speak <br>
      Of one that loved not wisely but too well;<br>
      Of one not easily jealous, but being wrought<br>
      Perplex'd in the extreme; of one whose hand,<br>
      Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away<br>
      Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdued eyes, <br>
      Albeit unused to the melting mood,<br>
      Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees<br>
      Their medicinal gum. Set you down this;<br>
      And say besides, that in Aleppo once,<br>
      Where a malignant and a turban'd Turk <br>
      Beat a Venetian and traduced the state,<br>
      I took by the throat the circumcised dog,<br>
      And smote him, thus. <br><br>
