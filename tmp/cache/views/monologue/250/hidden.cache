          <b>Juliet.</b> O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? <br>
      Deny thy father and refuse thy name;<br>
      Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,<br>
      And I'll no longer be a Capulet. <br><br>

<del><b>Romeo.</b> <i>[Aside]</i> Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?</del> <br><br>

<b>Juliet.</b> 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;<br>
      Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.<br>
      What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,<br>
      Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part<br>
      Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!<br>
      What's in a name? that which we call a rose <br>
      By any other name would smell as sweet;<br>
      So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,<br>
      Retain that dear perfection which he owes<br>
      Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,<br>
      And for that name which is no part of thee<br>
      Take all myself.
