          The quality of mercy is not strain'd,<br>
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven<br>
Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest;<br>
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:<br>
'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes<br>
The throned monarch better than his crown; <br>
His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,<br>
The attribute to awe and majesty,<br>
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;<br>
But mercy is above this sceptred sway;<br>
It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,<br>
It is an attribute to God himself;<br>
And earthly power doth then show likest God's<br>
When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,<br>
Though justice be thy plea, consider this,<br>
That, in the course of justice, none of us<br>
Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;<br>
And that same prayer doth teach us all to render<br>
The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much<br>
To mitigate the justice of thy plea;<br>
Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice<br>
Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there. <br>
