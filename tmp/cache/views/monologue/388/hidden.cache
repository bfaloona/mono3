          Thou art, great lord, my father's sister's son, <br>
A cousin-german to great Priam's seed;<br>
The obligation of our blood forbids<br>
A gory emulation 'twixt us twain:<br>
Were thy commixtion Greek and Trojan so<br>
That thou couldst say 'This hand is Grecian all,<br>
And this is Trojan; the sinews of this leg<br>
All Greek, and this all Troy; my mother's blood<br>
Runs on the dexter cheek, and this sinister<br>
Bounds in my father's;' by Jove multipotent,<br>
Thou shouldst not bear from me a Greekish member<br>
Wherein my sword had not impressure made<br>
Of our rank feud: but the just gods gainsay<br>
That any drop thou borrow'dst from thy mother,<br>
My sacred aunt, should by my mortal sword<br>
Be drain'd! Let me embrace thee, Ajax: <br>
By him that thunders, thou hast lusty arms;<br>
Hector would have them fall upon him thus:<br>
Cousin, all honour to thee!
