          By nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale; <br>
And when 'tis told, O that my heart would burst!<br>
The bloody proclamation to escape<br>
That follow'd me so near (O, our lives' sweetness!<br>
That with the pain of death would hourly die<br>
Rather than die at once!) taught me to shift <br>
Into a madman's rags, t' assume a semblance<br>
That very dogs disdain'd; and in this habit<br>
Met I my father with his bleeding rings,<br>
Their precious stones new lost; became his guide,<br>
Led him, begg'd for him, sav'd him from despair;<br>
Never (O fault!) reveal'd myself unto him<br>
Until some half hour past, when I was arm'd,<br>
Not sure, though hoping of this good success,<br>
I ask'd his blessing, and from first to last<br>
Told him my pilgrimage. But his flaw'd heart <br>
(Alack, too weak the conflict to support!)<br>
'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,<br>
Burst smilingly.
