          Two nights together had these gentlemen <br>
(Marcellus and Bernardo) on their watch<br>
In the dead vast and middle of the night<br>
Been thus encount'red. A figure like your father,<br>
Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,<br>
Appears before them and with solemn march<br>
Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk'd<br>
By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,<br>
Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd<br>
Almost to jelly with the act of fear,<br>
Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me<br>
In dreadful secrecy impart they did,<br>
And I with them the third night kept the watch;<br>
Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,<br>
Form of the thing, each word made true and good,<br>
The apparition comes. I knew your father.<br>
These hands are not more like. <br>
