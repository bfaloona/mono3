          What glory our Achilles shares from Hector, <br>
Were he not proud, we all should share with him:<br>
But he already is too insolent;<br>
And we were better parch in Afric sun<br>
Than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes,<br>
Should he 'scape Hector fair: if he were foil'd, <br>
Why then, we did our main opinion crush<br>
In taint of our best man. No, make a lottery;<br>
And, by device, let blockish Ajax draw<br>
The sort to fight with Hector: among ourselves<br>
Give him allowance for the better man; <br>
For that will physic the great Myrmidon<br>
Who broils in loud applause, and make him fall<br>
His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends.<br>
If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off,<br>
We'll dress him up in voices: if he fail, <br>
Yet go we under our opinion still<br>
That we have better men. But, hit or miss,<br>
Our project's life this shape of sense assumes:<br>
Ajax employ'd plucks down Achilles' plumes.
