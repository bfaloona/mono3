          Help me, Lysander, help me! do thy best<br>
To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast!<br>
Ay me, for pity! what a dream was here!<br>
Lysander, look how I do quake with fear:<br>
Methought a serpent eat my heart away, <br>
And you sat smiling at his cruel pray.<br>
Lysander! what, removed? Lysander! lord!<br>
What, out of hearing? gone? no sound, no word?<br>
Alack, where are you speak, an if you hear;<br>
Speak, of all loves! I swoon almost with fear. <br>
No? then I well perceive you all not nigh<br>
Either death or you I'll find immediately.
