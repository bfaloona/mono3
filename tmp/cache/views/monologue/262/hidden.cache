          Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!<br>
Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,<br>
So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies<br>
Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.<br>
Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine<br>
Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline! <br>
How much salt water thrown away in waste,<br>
To season love, that of it doth not taste!<br>
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,<br>
Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;<br>
Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit<br>
Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:<br>
If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,<br>
Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:<br>
And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,<br>
Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.
