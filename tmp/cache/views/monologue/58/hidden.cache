          [Awaking] When my cue comes, call me, and I will 
answer: my next is, 'Most fair Pyramus.' Heigh-ho! 
Peter Quince! Flute, the bellows-mender! Snout, 
the tinker! Starveling! God's my life, stolen  
hence, and left me asleep! I have had a most rare 
vision. I have had a dream, past the wit of man to 
say what dream it was: man is but an ass, if he go 
about to expound this dream. Methought I was--there 
is no man can tell what. Methought I was,.and  
methought I had,.but man is but a patched fool, if 
he will offer to say what methought I had. The eye 
of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not 
seen, man's hand is not able to taste, his tongue 
to conceive, nor his heart to report, what my dream  
was. I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of 
this dream: it shall be called Bottom's Dream, 
because it hath no bottom; and I will sing it in the 
latter end of a play, before the duke: 
peradventure, to make it the more gracious, I shall 
sing it at her death.
