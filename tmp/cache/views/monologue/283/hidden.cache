          <b>Iachimo.</b> Upon a time,â€”unhappy was the clock<br>
 That struck the hour!â€”it was in Rome,â€”accursed<br>
 The mansion where!â€”'twas at a feast,â€”O, would<br>
 Our viands had been poison'd, or at least <br>
 Those which I heaved to head!â€”the good Posthumusâ€”<br>
 What should I say? he was too good to be<br>
 Where ill men were; and was the best of all<br>
 Amongst the rarest of good ones,â€”sitting sadly,<br>
 Hearing us praise our loves of Italy <br>
 For beauty that made barren the swell'd boast<br>
 Of him that best could speak, for feature, laming<br>
 The shrine of Venus, or straight-pight Minerva.<br>
 Postures beyond brief nature, for condition,<br>
 A shop of all the qualities that man <br>
 Loves woman for, besides that hook of wiving,<br>
 Fairness which strikes the eyeâ€” 
<br><br>
<del><b>Cymbeline.</b> I stand on fire:<br>
 Come to the matter.</del> <br><br>

<b>Iachimo.</b> All too soon I shall,<br>
 Unless thou wouldst grieve quickly. This Posthumus,<br>
 Most like a noble lord in love and one<br>
 That had a royal lover, took his hint;<br>
 And, not dispraising whom we praised,â€”therein<br>
 He was as calm as virtueâ€”he began<br>
 His mistress' picture; which by his tongue<br>
 being made,<br>
 And then a mind put in't, either our brags<br>
 Were crack'd of kitchen-trolls, or his description<br>
 Proved us unspeaking sots. </p>

<del><b>Cymbeline.</b> Nay, nay, to the purpose.</del><br><br>

<b>Iachimo.</b> Your daughter's chastityâ€”there it begins.<br>
 He spake of her, as Dian had hot dreams,<br>
 And she alone were cold: whereat I, wretch,<br>
 Made scruple of his praise; and wager'd with him<br>
 Pieces of gold 'gainst this which then he wore<br>
 Upon his honour'd finger, to attain<br>
 In suit the place of's bed and win this ring<br>
 By hers and mine adultery. He, true knight,<br>
 No lesser of her honour confident<br>
 Than I did truly find her, stakes this ring;<br>
 And would so, had it been a carbuncle<br>
 Of Phoebus' wheel, and might so safely, had it<br>
 Been all the worth of's car. Away to Britain<br>
 Post I in this design: well may you, sir,<br>
 Remember me at court; where I was taught<br>
 Of your chaste daughter the wide difference<br>
 'Twixt amorous and villanous. Being thus quench'd<br>
 Of hope, not longing, mine Italian brain<br>
 'Gan in your duller Britain operate<br>
 Most vilely; for my vantage, excellent:<br>
 And, to be brief, my practise so prevail'd,<br>
 That I return'd with simular proof enough<br>
 To make the noble Leonatus mad,<br>
 By wounding his belief in her renown<br>
 With tokens thus, and thus; averting notes<br>
 Of chamber-hanging, pictures, this her bracelet,â€”<br>
 O cunning, how I got it!â€”nay, some marks<br>
 Of secret on her person, that he could not<br>
 But think her bond of chastity quite crack'd,<br>
 I having ta'en the forfeit. Whereuponâ€”<br>
 Methinks, I see him nowâ€” <br>
