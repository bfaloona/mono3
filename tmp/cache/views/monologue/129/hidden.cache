      <div class="monologue_preview">
          No blame be to you, sir; for all was lost,<br>
      But that the heavens fought: the king himself<br>
      Of his wings destitute, the army broken,<br>
      And but the backs of Britons seen, all flying<br>
      Through a straight lane; the enemy full-hearted, <br>
      Lolling the tongue with slaughtering, having work<br>
      More plentiful than tools to do't, struck down<br>
      Some mortally, some slightly touch'd, some falling<br>
      Merely through fear; that the straight pass was damm'd<br>
      With dead men hurt behind, and cowards living <br>
      To die with lengthen'd shame. <br>
<p>
    <del> Lord. Where was this lane? </del>
<p>
Close by the battle, ditch'd, and wall'd with turf;<br>
      Which gave advantage to an ancient soldier,<br>
      An honest one, I warrant; who deserved <br>
      So long a breeding as his white beard came to,<br>
      In doing this for's country: athwart the lane,<br>
      He, with two striplings-lads more like to run<br>
      The country base than to commit such slaughter<br>
      With faces fit for masks, or rather fairer <br>
      Than those for preservation cased, or shame.<br>
      Made good the passage; cried to those that fled,<br>
      'Our Britain s harts die flying, not our men:<br>
      To darkness fleet souls that fly backwards. Stand;<br>
      Or we are Romans and will give you that <br>
      Like beasts which you shun beastly, and may save,<br>
      But to look back in frown: stand, stand.'
      These three,<br>
      Three thousand confident, in act as many.<br>
      For three performers are the file when all <br>
      The rest do nothing.with this word 'Stand, stand,'<br>
      Accommodated by the place, more charming<br>
      With their own nobleness, which could have turn'd<br>
      A distaff to a lance, gilded pale looks,<br>
      Part shame, part spirit renew'd; that some, 
      turn'd coward<br>
      But by example.O, a sin in war,<br>
      Damn'd in the first beginners!--gan to look<br>
      The way that they did, and to grin like lions<br>
      Upon the pikes o' the hunters. Then began <br>
      A stop i' the chaser, a retire, anon<br>
      A rout, confusion thick; forthwith they fly<br>
      Chickens, the way which they stoop'd eagles; slaves,<br>
      The strides they victors made: and now our cowards,<br>
      Like fragments in hard voyages, became <br>
      The life o' the need: having found the backdoor open<br>
      Of the unguarded hearts, heavens, how they wound!<br>
      Some slain before; some dying; some their friends<br>
      O'er borne i' the former wave: ten, chased by one,<br>
      Are now each one the slaughter-man of twenty: <br>
      Those that would die or ere resist are grown<br>
      The mortal bugs o' the field. <br>
<p>
   <del> Lord. This was strange chance
      A narrow lane, an old man, and two boys. </del>
<p>
Nay, do not wonder at it: you are made <br>
      Rather to wonder at the things you hear<br>
      Than to work any. Will you rhyme upon't,<br>
      And vent it for a mockery? Here is one:<br>
      'Two boys, an old man twice a boy, a lane,<br>
      Preserved the Britons, was the Romans' bane.' <br>
<p>
   <del> Lord. Nay, be not angry, sir. </del>
<p>
'Lack, to what end?<br>
      Who dares not stand his foe, I'll be his friend;<br>
      For if he'll do as he is made to do,<br>
      I know he'll quickly fly my friendship too. <br>
      You have put me into rhyme. <br>
