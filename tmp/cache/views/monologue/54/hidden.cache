          <div align='right'>I pray thee, give it me.</div>
I know a bank where the wild thyme blows,<br>
Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows,<br>
Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine, <br>
With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine:<br>
There sleeps Titania sometime of the night,<br>
Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight;<br>
And there the snake throws her enamell'd skin,<br>
Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in: <br>
And with the juice of this I'll streak her eyes,<br>
And make her full of hateful fantasies.<br>
Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove:<br>
A sweet Athenian lady is in love<br>
With a disdainful youth: anoint his eyes; <br>
But do it when the next thing he espies<br>
May be the lady: thou shalt know the man<br>
By the Athenian garments he hath on.<br>
Effect it with some care, that he may prove<br>
More fond on her than she upon her love:<br>
And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow.
