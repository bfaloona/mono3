          Thus time we waste, and longest leagues make short; <br>
Sail seas in cockles, have an wish but for't;<br>
Making, to take your imagination,<br>
From bourn to bourn, region to region.<br>
By you being pardon'd, we commit no crime<br>
To use one language in each several clime 1880<br>
Where our scenes seem to live. I do beseech you<br>
To learn of me, who stand i' the gaps to teach you,<br>
The stages of our story. Pericles<br>
Is now again thwarting the wayward seas,<br>
Attended on by many a lord and knight. <br>
To see his daughter, all his life's delight.<br>
Old Escanes, whom Helicanus late<br>
Advanced in time to great and high estate,<br>
Is left to govern. Bear you it in mind,<br>
Old Helicanus goes along behind. 1890<br>
Well-sailing ships and bounteous winds have brought<br>
This king to Tarsus,â€”think his pilot thought;<br>
So with his steerage shall your thoughts grow on,â€”<br>
To fetch his daughter home, who first is gone.<br>
Like motes and shadows see them move awhile; <br>
Your ears unto your eyes I'll reconcile.<br>
DUMB SHOW.<br>
[Enter PERICLES, at one door, with all his train;]<br>
CLEON and DIONYZA, at the other. CLEON shows<br>
PERICLES the tomb; whereat PERICLES makes<br>
lamentation, puts on sackcloth, and in a mighty<br>
passion departs. Then exeunt CLEON and DIONYZA]<br>
See how belief may suffer by foul show!<br>
This borrow'd passion stands for true old woe;<br>
And Pericles, in sorrow all devour'd, <br>
With sighs shot through, and biggest tears o'ershower'd,<br>
Leaves Tarsus and again embarks. He swears<br>
Never to wash his face, nor cut his hairs:<br>
He puts on sackcloth, and to sea. He bears <br>
A tempest, which his mortal vessel tears,<br>
And yet he rides it out. Now please you wit.<br>
The epitaph is for Marina writ By wicked Dionyza.<br>
[Reads the inscription on MARINA's monument] <br>
'The fairest, sweet'st, and best lies here,<br>
Who wither'd in her spring of year.<br>
She was of Tyrus the king's daughter,<br>
On whom foul death hath made this slaughter;<br>
Marina was she call'd; and at her birth, <br>
Thetis, being proud, swallow'd some part o' the earth:<br>
Therefore the earth, fearing to be o'erflow'd,<br>
Hath Thetis' birth-child on the heavens bestow'd:<br>
Wherefore she does, and swears she'll never stint,<br>
Make raging battery upon shores of flint.' <br>
No visor does become black villany<br>
So well as soft and tender flattery.<br>
Let Pericles believe his daughter's dead,<br>
And bear his courses to be ordered<br>
By Lady Fortune; while our scene must play <br>
His daughter's woe and heavy well-a-day<br>
In her unholy service. Patience, then,<br>
And think you now are all in Mytilene.
