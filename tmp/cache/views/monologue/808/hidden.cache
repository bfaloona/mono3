          Nay, go not from us thus.<br>
If it were so that our request did tend<br>
To save the Romans, thereby to destroy<br>
The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us,<br>
As poisonous of your honour: no; our suit<br>
Is that you reconcile them: while the Volsces<br>
May say 'This mercy we have show'd;' the Romans,<br>
'This we received;' and each in either side<br>
Give the all-hail to thee and cry 'Be blest <br>
For making up this peace!' Thou know'st, great son,<br>
The end of war's uncertain, but this certain,<br>
That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit<br>
Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name,<br>
Whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses;<br>
Whose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble,<br>
But with his last attempt he wiped it out;<br>
Destroy'd his country, and his name remains<br>
To the ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son:<br>
Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour,<br>
To imitate the graces of the gods;<br>
To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air,<br>
And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt<br>
That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?<br>
Think'st thou it honourable for a noble man<br>
Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:<br>
He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy:<br>
Perhaps thy childishness will move him more<br>
Than can our reasons. There's no man in the world<br>
More bound to 's mother; yet here he lets me prate<br>
Like one i' the stocks. Thou hast never in thy life<br>
Show'd thy dear mother any courtesy,<br>
When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,<br>
Has cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home,<br>
Loaden with honour. Say my request's unjust,<br>
And spurn me back: but if it be not so,<br>
Thou art not honest; and the gods will plague thee,<br>
That thou restrain'st from me the duty which<br>
To a mother's part belongs. He turns away:<br>
Down, ladies; let us shame him with our knees.<br>
To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride<br>
Than pity to our prayers. Down: an end;<br>
This is the last: so we will home to Rome,<br>
And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold 's:<br>
This boy, that cannot tell what he would have<br>
But kneels and holds up bands for fellowship,<br>
Does reason our petition with more strength<br>
Than thou hast to deny 't. Come, let us go:<br>
This fellow had a Volscian to his mother;<br>
His wife is in Corioli and his child<br>
Like him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch:<br>
I am hush'd until our city be a-fire,<br>
And then I'll speak a little.
