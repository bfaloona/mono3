          <b>Titania.</b> <i>[Awaking]</i> What angel wakes me from my flowery bed? <br><br>

<del><b>Bottom.</b> <i>[Sings]</i><br>
      The finch, the sparrow and the lark,<br>
      The plain-song cuckoo gray,<br>
      Whose note full many a man doth mark,<br>
      And dares not answer nay;. <br>
      for, indeed, who would set his wit to so foolish<br>
      a bird? who would give a bird the lie, though he cry<br>
      'cuckoo' never so?</del> <br><br>

<b>Titania.</b> I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again:<br>
      Mine ear is much enamour'd of thy note; <br>
      So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape;<br>
      And thy fair virtue's force perforce doth move me<br>
      On the first view to say, to swear, I love thee. <br><br>

<del><b>Bottom.</b> Methinks, mistress, you should have little reason<br>
      for that: and yet, to say the truth, reason and <br>
      love keep little company together now-a-days; the<br>
      more the pity that some honest neighbours will not<br>
      make them friends. Nay, I can gleek upon occasion. </del><br><br>

<b>Titania.</b> Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful.<br><br> 

<del><b>Bottom.</b> Not so, neither: but if I had wit enough to get out<br>
      of this wood, I have enough to serve mine own turn. </del><br><br>

<b>Titania.</b> Out of this wood do not desire to go:<br>
      Thou shalt remain here, whether thou wilt or no.<br>
      I am a spirit of no common rate;<br>
      The summer still doth tend upon my state;<br>
      And I do love thee: therefore, go with me;<br>
      I'll give thee fairies to attend on thee,<br>
      And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep,<br>
      And sing while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep;<br>
      And I will purge thy mortal grossness so<br>
      That thou shalt like an airy spirit go.
