      <div class="monologue_preview">
          Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice<br>
And could of men distinguish, her election<br>
Hath seal'd thee for herself. For thou hast been<br>
As one, in suff'ring all, that suffers nothing;<br>
A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards<br>
Hast ta'en with equal thanks; and blest are those<br>
Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled<br>
That they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger<br>
To sound what stop she please. Give me that man <br>
That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him<br>
In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,<br>
As I do thee. Something too much of this I<br>
There is a play to-night before the King.<br>
One scene of it comes near the circumstance, <br>
Which I have told thee, of my father's death.<br>
I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,<br>
Even with the very comment of thy soul<br>
Observe my uncle. If his occulted guilt<br>
Do not itself unkennel in one speech, <br>
It is a damned ghost that we have seen,<br>
And my imaginations are as foul<br>
As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;<br>
For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,<br>
And after we will both our judgments join<br>
In censure of his seeming. <br>
