          The more my wrong, the more his spite appears.<br>
What, did he marry me to famish me?<br>
Beggars that come unto my father's door<br>
Upon entreaty have a present alms;<br>
If not, elsewhere they meet with charity;<br>
But I, who never knew how to entreat,<br>
Nor never needed that I should entreat,<br>
Am starv'd for meat, giddy for lack of sleep; <br>
With oaths kept waking, and with brawling fed;<br>
And that which spites me more than all these wants-<br>
He does it under name of perfect love;<br>
As who should say, if I should sleep or eat,<br>
'Twere deadly sickness or else present death. <br>
I prithee go and get me some repast;<br>
I care not what, so it be wholesome food.
