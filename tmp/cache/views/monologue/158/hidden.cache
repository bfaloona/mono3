          Away, then! I am lock'd in one of them:<br>
If you do love me, you will find me out.<br>
Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof.<br>
Let music sound while he doth make his choice;<br>
Then, if he lose, he makes a swan-like end,<br>
Fading in music: that the comparison<br>
May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream<br>
And watery death-bed for him. He may win;<br>
And what is music then? Then music is<br>
Even as the flourish when true subjects bow<br>
To a new-crowned monarch: such it is<br>
As are those dulcet sounds in break of day<br>
That creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear,<br>
And summon him to marriage. Now he goes,<br>
With no less presence, but with much more love,<br>
Than young Alcides, when he did redeem<br>
The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy<br>
To the sea-monster: I stand for sacrifice<br>
The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives,<br>
With bleared visages, come forth to view<br>
The issue of the exploit. Go, Hercules!<br>
Live thou, I live: with much, much more dismay<br>
I view the fight than thou that makest the fray.<br>
<i>[Music, whilst BASSANIO comments on the caskets to himself]</i>
SONG.<br>
Tell me where is fancy bred,<br>
Or in the heart, or in the head?<br>
How begot, how nourished?<br>
Reply, reply.<br>
It is engender'd in the eyes,<br>
With gazing fed; and fancy dies<br>
In the cradle where it lies.<br>
Let us all ring fancy's knell<br>
I'll begin it,.Ding, dong, bell. <br>
