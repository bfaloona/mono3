      <div class="monologue_preview">
          The crickets sing, and man's o'erlabour'd sense	<br>
Repairs itself by rest. Our Tarquin thus  <br>
Did softly press the rushes ere he waken'd <br>
The chastity he wounded. Cytherea,  <br>
How bravely thou becom'st thy bed! fresh lily,<br> 
And whiter than the sheets! That I might touch!<br>
But kiss: one kiss! Rubies unparagon'd, <br>
How dearly they do't! 'Tis her breathing that<br> 
Perfumes the chamber thus; the flame of the taper <br>
Bows toward her, and would under-peep her lids,  <br>
To see the enclosed lights, now canopied <br>
Under these windows, white and azure lac'd <br>
With blue of heaven's own tinct. But my design,<br> 
To note the chamber: I will write all down: <br>
Such and such pictures; there the window; such <br>
Th' adornment of her bed; the arras, figures, <br>
Why, such and such; and the contents o' the story.<br> 
Ah! but some natural notes about her body,  <br>
Above ten thousand meaner moveables <br>
Would testify, to enrich mine inventory.<br> 
O sleep! thou ape of death, lie dull upon her;<br> 
And be her senses but as a monument  <br>
Thus in a chapel lying. Come off, come off;.  [Taking off her bracelet.]<br> 
As slippery as the Gordian knot was hard! <br>
'Tis mine; and this will witness outwardly, <br>
As strongly as the conscience does within, <br>
To the madding of her lord. On her left breast <br>
A mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson drops <br>
I' the bottom of a cowslip: here's a voucher;  <br>
Stronger than ever law could make: this secret  <br>
Will force him think I have pick'd the lock and ta'en<br> 
The treasure of her honour. No more. To what end? <br>
Why should I write this down, that's riveted, <br>
Screw'd to my memory? She hath been reading late  <br>
The tale of Tereus; here the leaf's turn'd down <br>
Where Philomel gave up. I have enough: <br>
To the trunk again, and shut the spring of it.<br> 
Swift, swift, you dragons of the night, that dawning<br>  
May bare the raven's eye! I lodge in fear; <br>
Though this a heavenly angel, hell is here.  [Clock strikes.]<br>
One, two, three: time, time!  [Goes into the trunk. The scene closes.]<br>
