      <div class="monologue_preview">
          All the world's a stage,<br>
And all the men and women merely players:<Br>
They have their exits and their entrances; <br>
And one man in his time plays many parts, <br>
His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,<br> 
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.	<br>
And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel,<br> 
And shining morning face, creeping like snail <br>
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover, <br>
Sighing like furnace, with a woful ballad<br>
Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,<br> 
Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard, <br>
Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel, <br>
Seeking the bubble reputation <br>
Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,<br> 
In fair round belly with good capon lin'd, <br>
With eyes severe, and beard of formal cut,  <br>
Full of wise saws and modern instances; 164<br>
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts <br>
Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon, <br>
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side, <br>
His youthful hose well sav'd, a world too wide<br>
For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,  <br>
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes <br>
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all, <br>
That ends this strange eventful history, <br>
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,  <br>
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.<br>
