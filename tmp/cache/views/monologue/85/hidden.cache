          'Tis only title thou disdain'st in her, the which<br>
I can build up. Strange is it that our bloods,<br>
Of colour, weight, and heat, pour'd all together,<br>
Would quite confound distinction, yet stand off<br>
In differences so mighty. If she be<br>
All that is virtuous, save what thou dislikest,<br>
A poor physician's daughter, thou dislikest<br>
Of virtue for the name: but do not so:<br>
From lowest place when virtuous things proceed,<br>
The place is dignified by the doer's deed:<br>
Where great additions swell's, and virtue none,<br>
It is a dropsied honour. Good alone<br>
Is good without a name. Vileness is so:<br>
The property by what it is should go,<br>
Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair;<br>
In these to nature she's immediate heir,<br>
And these breed honour: that is honour's scorn,<br>
Which challenges itself as honour's born<br>
And is not like the sire: honours thrive,<br>
When rather from our acts we them derive<br>
Than our foregoers: the mere word's a slave<br>
Debosh'd on every tomb, on every grave<br>
A lying trophy, and as oft is dumb<br>
Where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb<br>
Of honour'd bones indeed. What should be said?<br>
If thou canst like this creature as a maid,<br>
I can create the rest: virtue and she<br>
Is her own dower; honour and wealth from me.<p>
<font size='-1'>BERTRAM
I cannot love her, nor will strive to do't.</font><p>
KING<br>
Thou wrong'st thyself, if thou shouldst strive to choose.<p>
<font size='-1'>HELENA<br>
That you are well restored, my lord, I'm glad:<br>
Let the rest go.</font><p>
KING<br>
My honour's at the stake; which to defeat,<br>
I must produce my power. Here, take her hand,<br>
Proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift;<br>
That dost in vile misprision shackle up<br>
My love and her desert; that canst not dream,<br>
We, poising us in her defective scale,<br>
Shall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know,<br>
It is in us to plant thine honour where<br>
We please to have it grow. Cheque thy contempt:<br>
Obey our will, which travails in thy good:<br>
Believe not thy disdain, but presently<br>
Do thine own fortunes that obedient right<br>
Which both thy duty owes and our power claims;<br>
Or I will throw thee from my care for ever<br>
Into the staggers and the careless lapse<br>
Of youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate<br>
Loosing upon thee, in the name of justice,<br>
Without all terms of pity. Speak; thine answer.<br>
