          Thou dost thy office fairly. Turn thee back.<br>
And tell thy king I do not seek him now;<br>
But could be willing to march on to Calais<br>
Without impeachment: for, to say the sooth,<br>
Though 'tis no wisdom to confess so much<br>
Unto an enemy of craft and vantage,<br>
My people are with sickness much enfeebled,<br>
My numbers lessened, and those few I have<br>
Almost no better than so many French;<br>
Who when they were in health, I tell thee, herald, <br>
I thought upon one pair of English legs<br>
Did march three Frenchmen. Yet, forgive me, God,<br>
That I do brag thus! This your air of France<br>
Hath blown that vice in me: I must repent.<br>
Go therefore, tell thy master here I am; <br>
My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk,<br>
My army but a weak and sickly guard;<br>
Yet, God before, tell him we will come on,<br>
Though France himself and such another neighbour<br>
Stand in our way. There's for thy labour, Montjoy. <br>
Go bid thy master well advise himself:<br>
If we may pass, we will; if we be hinder'd,<br>
We shall your tawny ground with your red blood<br>
Discolour: and so Montjoy, fare you well.<br>
The sum of all our answer is but this: <br>
We would not seek a battle, as we are;<br>
Nor, as we are, we say we will not shun it:<br>
So tell your master.
