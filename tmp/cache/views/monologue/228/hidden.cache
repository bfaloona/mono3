          Do not think so; you shall not find it so:<br>
And God forgive them that so much have sway'd<br>
Your majesty's good thoughts away from me! <br>
I will redeem all this on Percy's head<br>
And in the closing of some glorious day<br>
Be bold to tell you that I am your son;<br>
When I will wear a garment all of blood
And stain my favours in a bloody mask,<br>
Which, wash'd away, shall scour my shame with it:<br>
And that shall be the day, whene'er it lights,<br>
That this same child of honour and renown,<br>
This gallant Hotspur, this all-praised knight,<br>
And your unthought-of Harry chance to meet. <br>
For every honour sitting on his helm,<br>
Would they were multitudes, and on my head<br>
My shames redoubled! for the time will come,<br>
That I shall make this northern youth exchange<br>
His glorious deeds for my indignities. <br>
Percy is but my factor, good my lord,<br>
To engross up glorious deeds on my behalf;<br>
And I will call him to so strict account,<br>
That he shall render every glory up,<br>
Yea, even the slightest worship of his time, <br>
Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart.<br>
This, in the name of God, I promise here:<br>
The which if He be pleased I shall perform,<br>
I do beseech your majesty may salve<br>
The long-grown wounds of my intemperance:<br>
If not, the end of life cancels all bands;<br>
And I will die a hundred thousand deaths<br>
Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
