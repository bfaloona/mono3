          [Oli.]  When last the young Orlando parted from you<br>	 
He left a promise to return again  <br>
Within an hour; and, pacing through the forest,<br>
Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy, <br>
Lo, what befell! he threw his eye aside, <br>
And mark what object did present itself:  <br>
Under an oak, whose boughs were moss'd with age, <br>
And high top bald with dry antiquity,<br> 
A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,<br> 
Lay sleeping on his back: about his neck <br>
A green and gilded snake had wreath'd itself, <br>
Who with her head nimble in threats approach'd  <br>
The opening of his mouth; but suddenly, <br>
Seeing Orlando, it unlink'd itself, <br>
And with indented glides did slip away  <br>
Into a bush; under which bush's shade <br>
A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,  <br>
Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch,<br> 
When that the sleeping man should stir; for 'tis <br>
The royal disposition of that beast <br>
To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead: <br>
This seen, Orlando did approach the man, <br>
And found it was his brother, his elder brother. <br>
<font size='-1' style='text-decoration: line-through;'> 
[Cel.]  O! I have heard him speak of that same brother;<br>
And he did render him the most unnatural <br>
That liv'd 'mongst men. <br> 
</font>
  [Oli.]        And well he might so do,<br>
For well I know he was unnatural. <br>
<font size='-1' style='text-decoration: line-through;'>
  [Ros.]  But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,<br> 
Food to the suck'd and hungry lioness? <br>
</font>
  [Oli.]  Twice did he turn his back and purpos'd so;<br>
But kindness, nobler ever than revenge, <br>
And nature, stronger than his just occasion,<br> 
Made him give battle to the lioness, <br>
Who quickly fell before him: in which hurtling<br>
From miserable slumber I awak'd. <br>
<font size='-1' style='text-decoration: line-through;'>
  [Cel.]  Are you his brother? <br>
  [Ros.]        Was it you he rescu'd?<br> 
  [Cel.]  Was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?<br>
</font>
  [Oli.]  'Twas I; but 'tis not I. I do not shame <br>
To tell you what I was, since my conversion <br>
So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am. <br>
<font size='-1' style='text-decoration: line-through;'>
  [Ros.]  But, for the bloody napkin?<br>
</font>
  [Oli.]        By and by. <br>
When from the first to last, betwixt us two, <br>
Tears our recountments had most kindly bath'd, <br>
As how I came into that desert place:. <br>
In brief, he led me to the gentle duke,	 <br>
Who gave me fresh array and entertainment, <br>
Committing me unto my brother's love;<br> 
Who led me instantly unto his cave,<br>
There stripp'd himself; and here, upon his arm<br> 
The lioness had torn some flesh away, <br>
Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted,<br> 
And cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind. <br>
Brief, I recover'd him, bound up his wound; <br>
And, after some small space, being strong at heart,<br> 
He sent me hither, stranger as I am, <br>
To tell this story, that you might excuse<br>
His broken promise; and to give this napkin, <br>
Dy'd in his blood, unto the shepherd youth <br>
That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.<br>
