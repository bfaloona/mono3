          O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,<br>
That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!<br>
Thou art the ruins of the noblest man <br>
That ever lived in the tide of times.<br>
Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!<br>
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy,—<br>
Which, like dumb mouths, do ope their ruby lips,<br>
To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue— <br>
A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;<br>
Domestic fury and fierce civil strife<br>
Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;<br>
Blood and destruction shall be so in use<br>
And dreadful objects so familiar <br>
That mothers shall but smile when they behold<br>
Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war;<br>
All pity choked with custom of fell deeds:<br>
And Caesar's spirit, ranging for revenge,<br>
With Ate by his side come hot from hell, <br>
Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice<br>
Cry 'Havoc,' and let slip the dogs of war;<br>
That this foul deed shall smell above the earth<br>
With carrion men, groaning for burial.
