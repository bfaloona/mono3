          The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;<br>
In half an hour she promised to return.<br>
Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.<br>
O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,<br>
Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,<br>
Driving back shadows over louring hills: <br>
Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,<br>
And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.<br>
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill<br>
Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve<br>
Is three long hours, yet she is not come. <br>
Had she affections and warm youthful blood,<br>
She would be as swift in motion as a ball;<br>
My words would bandy her to my sweet love,<br>
And his to me:<br>
But old folks, many feign as they were dead; <br>
Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.<br>
O God, she comes!
