          This deed unshapes me quite, makes me unpregnant<br>
And dull to all proceedings. A deflower'd maid!<br>
And by an eminent body that enforced<br>
The law against it! But that her tender shame<br>
Will not proclaim against her maiden loss,<br>
How might she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no;<br>
For my authority bears of a credent bulk,<br>
That no particular scandal once can touch<br>
But it confounds the breather. He should have lived,<br>
Save that riotous youth, with dangerous sense,<br>
Might in the times to come have ta'en revenge,<br>
By so receiving a dishonour'd life<br>
With ransom of such shame. Would yet he had lived! <br>
A lack, when once our grace we have forgot,<br>
Nothing goes right: we would, and we would not. <br>
