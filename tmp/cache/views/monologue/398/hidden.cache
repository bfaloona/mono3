      <div class="monologue_preview">
          Even as one heat another heat expels,<br>
Or as one nail by strength drives out another,<br>
So the remembrance of my former love<br>
Is by a newer object quite forgotten.<br>
Is it mine, or Valentine's praise,<br>
Her true perfection, or my false transgression,<br>
That makes me reasonless to reason thus?<br>
She is fair; and so is Julia that I loveâ€”<br>
That I did love, for now my love is thaw'd;<br>
Which, like a waxen image, 'gainst a fire,<br>
Bears no impression of the thing it was.<br>
Methinks my zeal to Valentine is cold,<br>
And that I love him not as I was wont.<br>
O, but I love his lady too too much,<br>
And that's the reason I love him so little.<br>
How shall I dote on her with more advice,<br>
That thus without advice begin to love her!<br>
'Tis but her picture I have yet beheld,<br>
And that hath dazzled my reason's light;<br>
But when I look on her perfections,<br>
There is no reason but I shall be blind.<br>
If I can cheque my erring love, I will;<br>
If not, to compass her I'll use my skill.
