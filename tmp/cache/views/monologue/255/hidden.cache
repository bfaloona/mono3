          Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?<br>
Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,<br>
When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?<br>
But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?<br>
That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:<br>
Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;<br>
Your tributary drops belong to woe,<br>
Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.<br>
My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;<br>
And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:<br>
All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?<br>
Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,<br>
That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;<br>
But, O, it presses to my memory,<br>
Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:<br>
'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo.banished;'<br>
That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'<br>
Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death<br>
Was woe enough, if it had ended there:<br>
Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship <br>
And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,<br>
Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'<br>
Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,<br>
Which modern lamentations might have moved?<br>
But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death, <br>
'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,<br>
Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,<br>
All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'<br>
There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,<br>
In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
