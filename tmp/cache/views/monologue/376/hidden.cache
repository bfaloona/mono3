          You are for dreams and slumbers, brother priest;<br>
You fur your gloves with reason. Here are your reasons:<br>
You know an enemy intends you harm; <br>
You know a sword employ'd is perilous,<br>
And reason flies the object of all harm:<br>
Who marvels then, when Helenus beholds<br>
A Grecian and his sword, if he do set<br>
The very wings of reason to his heels <br>
And fly like chidden Mercury from Jove,<br>
Or like a star disorb'd? Nay, if we talk of reason,<br>
Let's shut our gates and sleep: manhood and honour<br>
Should have hare-hearts, would they but fat their thoughts <br>
With this cramm'd reason: reason and respect<br>
Make livers pale and lustihood deject.
