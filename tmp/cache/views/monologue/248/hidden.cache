          Even or odd, of all days in the year,<br>
Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.<br>
Susan and she.God rest all Christian souls!.<br>
Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;<br>
She was too good for me: but, as I said, <br>
On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;<br>
That shall she, marry; I remember it well.<br>
'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;<br>
And she was wean'd,.I never shall forget it,.<br>
Of all the days of the year, upon that day: <br>
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,<br>
Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;<br>
My lord and you were then at Mantua:.<br>
Nay, I do bear a brain:.but, as I said,<br>
When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple<br>
Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,<br>
To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!<br>
Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,<br>
To bid me trudge:<br>
And since that time it is eleven years;<br>
For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,<br>
She could have run and waddled all about;<br>
For even the day before, she broke her brow:<br>
And then my husband.God be with his soul!<br>
A' was a merry man.took up the child: <br>
'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?<br>
Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;<br>
Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,<br>
The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'<br>
To see, now, how a jest shall come about! <br>
I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,<br>
I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;<br>
And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'
