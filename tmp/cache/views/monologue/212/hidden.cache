          <div align="right">Orsino, noble sir,</div>
Be pleased that I shake off these names you give me:<br>
Antonio never yet was thief or pirate,<br>
Though I confess, on base and ground enough,<br>
Orsino's enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither: <br>
That most ingrateful boy there by your side,<br>
From the rude sea's enraged and foamy mouth<br>
Did I redeem; a wreck past hope he was:<br>
His life I gave him and did thereto add<br>
My love, without retention or restraint,<br>
All his in dedication; for his sake<br>
Did I expose myself, pure for his love,<br>
Into the danger of this adverse town;<br>
Drew to defend him when he was beset:<br>
Where being apprehended, his false cunning, <br>
Not meaning to partake with me in danger,<br>
Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance,<br>
And grew a twenty years removed thing<br>
While one would wink; denied me mine own purse,<br>
Which I had recommended to his use <br>
Not half an hour before.
