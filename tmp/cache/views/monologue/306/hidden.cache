          He who the sword of heaven will bear 1770<br>
Should be as holy as severe;<br>
Pattern in himself to know,<br>
Grace to stand, and virtue go;<br>
More nor less to others paying<br>
Than by self-offences weighing.<br>
Shame to him whose cruel striking<br>
Kills for faults of his own liking!<br>
Twice treble shame on Angelo,<br>
To weed my vice and let his grow!<br>
O, what may man within him hide,<br>
Though angel on the outward side!<br>
How may likeness made in crimes,<br>
Making practise on the times,<br>
To draw with idle spiders' strings<br>
Most ponderous and substantial things!<br>
Craft against vice I must apply:<br>
With Angelo to-night shall lie<br>
His old betrothed but despised;<br>
So disguise shall, by the disguised,<br>
Pay with falsehood false exacting, <br>
And perform an old contracting. <br>
