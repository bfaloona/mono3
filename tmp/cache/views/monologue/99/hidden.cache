      <div class="monologue_preview">
          His company must do his minions grace,<br>	 
Whilst I at home starve for a merry look.<br> 
Hath homely age the alluring beauty took <br>
From my poor cheek? then, he hath wasted it: <br>
Are my discourses dull? barren my wit? <br>
If voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd, <br>
Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard: <br>
Do their gay vestments his affections bait? <br>
That's not my fault; he's master of my state:<br>  
What ruins are in me that can be found  <br>
By him not ruin'd? then is he the ground <br>
Of my defeatures. My decayed fair  <br>
A sunny look of his would soon repair; <br>
But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale <br>
And feeds from home: poor I am but his stale.<br> 
 <font size='-1' style='text-decoration: line-through;'> [Luc.]  Self-harming jealousy! fie! beat it hence.</font><br>
  Adr.  Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.<br> 
I know his eye doth homage otherwhere, <br>
Or else what lets it but he would be here? <br>
Sister, you know he promis'd me a chain:<br>
Would that alone, alone he would detain,  <br>
So he would keep fair quarter with his bed! <br>
I see, the jewel best enamelled <br>
Will lose his beauty; and though gold bides still<br>
That others touch, yet often touching will <br>
Wear gold; and no man that hath a name, <br>
By falsehood and corruption doth it shame. <br>
Since that my beauty cannot please his eye,<br>
I'll weep what's left away, and weeping die.<br>
