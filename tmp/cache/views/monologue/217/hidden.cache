          Yea, there thou makest me sad and makest me sin<br>
In envy that my Lord Northumberland <br>
Should be the father to so blest a son,<br>
A son who is the theme of honour's tongue;<br>
Amongst a grove, the very straightest plant;<br>
Who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride:<br>
Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him, <br>
See riot and dishonour stain the brow<br>
Of my young Harry. O that it could be proved<br>
That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged<br>
In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,<br>
And call'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet!<br>
Then would I have his Harry, and he mine.<br>
But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,<br>
Of this young Percy's pride? the prisoners,<br>
Which he in this adventure hath surprised,<br>
To his own use he keeps; and sends me word, <br>
I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife. <br>
