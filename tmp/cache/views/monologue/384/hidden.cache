          <b>Ulysses.</b> I do not strain at the position,—<br>
 It is familiar,—but at the author's drift;<br>
 Who, in his circumstance, expressly proves<br>
 That no man is the lord of any thing, <br>
 Though in and of him there be much consisting,<br>
 Till he communicate his parts to others:<br>
 Nor doth he of himself know them for aught<br>
 Till he behold them form'd in the applause<br>
 Where they're extended; who, like an arch, reverberates<br>
 The voice again, or, like a gate of steel<br>
 Fronting the sun, receives and renders back<br>
 His figure and his heat. I was much wrapt in this;<br>
 And apprehended here immediately The unknown Ajax.<br>
 Heavens, what a man is there! a very horse,<br>
 That has he knows not what. Nature, what things there are<br>
 Most abject in regard and dear in use!<br>
 What things again most dear in the esteem <br>
 And poor in worth! Now shall we see to-morrow—<br>
 An act that very chance doth throw upon him—<br>
 Ajax renown'd. O heavens, what some men do,<br>
 While some men leave to do!<br>
 How some men creep in skittish fortune's hall, <br>
 Whiles others play the idiots in her eyes!<br>
 How one man eats into another's pride,<br>
 While pride is fasting in his wantonness!<br>
 To see these Grecian lords!—why, even already<br>
 They clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder, <br>
 As if his foot were on brave Hector's breast<br>
 And great Troy shrieking. <br>
<br>
<del><b>Achilles.</b> I do believe it; for they pass'd by me<br>
 As misers do by beggars, neither gave to me<br>
 Good word nor look: what, are my deeds forgot?</del> <br>
<br>
<b>Ulysses.</b> Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,<br>
 Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,<br>
 A great-sized monster of ingratitudes:<br>
 Those scraps are good deeds past; which are devour'd<br>
 As fast as they are made, forgot as soon <br>
 As done: perseverance, dear my lord,<br>
 Keeps honour bright: to have done is to hang<br>
 Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail<br>
 In monumental mockery. Take the instant way;<br>
 For honour travels in a strait so narrow,<br>
 Where one but goes abreast: keep then the path;<br>
 For emulation hath a thousand sons<br>
 That one by one pursue: if you give way,<br>
 Or hedge aside from the direct forthright,<br>
 Like to an enter'd tide, they all rush by<br>
 And leave you hindmost;<br>
 Or like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank,<br>
 Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,<br>
 O'er-run and trampled on: then what they do in present,<br>
 Though less than yours in past, must o'ertop yours; <br>
 For time is like a fashionable host<br>
 That slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand,<br>
 And with his arms outstretch'd, as he would fly,<br>
 Grasps in the comer: welcome ever smiles,<br>
 And farewell goes out sighing. O, let not virtue seek<br>
 Remuneration for the thing it was;<br>
 For beauty, wit,<br>
 High birth, vigour of bone, desert in service,<br>
 Love, friendship, charity, are subjects all <br>
 To envious and calumniating time.<br>
 One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,<br>
 That all with one consent praise new-born gawds,<br>
 Though they are made and moulded of things past,<br>
 And give to dust that is a little gilt <br>
 More laud than gilt o'er-dusted.<br>
 The present eye praises the present object.<br>
 Then marvel not, thou great and complete man,<br>
 That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax;<br>
 Since things in motion sooner catch the eye <br>
 Than what not stirs. The cry went once on thee,<br>
 And still it might, and yet it may again,<br>
 If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive<br>
 And case thy reputation in thy tent;<br>
 Whose glorious deeds, but in these fields of late, <br>
 Made emulous missions 'mongst the gods themselves<br>
 And drave great Mars to faction.
