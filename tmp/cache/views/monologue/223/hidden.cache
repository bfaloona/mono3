          'But for mine own part, my lord, I could be well<br>
contented to be there, in respect of the love I bear<br>
your house.' He could be contented: why is he not, <br>
then? In respect of the love he bears our house:<br>
he shows in this, he loves his own barn better than<br>
he loves our house. Let me see some more. 'The<br>
purpose you undertake is dangerous;'.why, that's<br>
certain: 'tis dangerous to take a cold, to sleep, to <br>
drink; but I tell you, my lord fool, out of this<br>
nettle, danger, we pluck this flower, safety. 'The<br>
purpose you undertake is dangerous; the friends you<br>
have named uncertain; the time itself unsorted; and<br>
your whole plot too light for the counterpoise of so <br>
great an opposition.' Say you so, say you so? I say<br>
unto you again, you are a shallow cowardly hind, and<br>
you lie. What a lack-brain is this! By the Lord,<br>
our plot is a good plot as ever was laid; our<br>
friends true and constant: a good plot, good <br>
friends, and full of expectation; an excellent plot,<br>
very good friends. What a frosty-spirited rogue is<br>
this! Why, my lord of York commends the plot and the<br>
general course of action. 'Zounds, an I were now by<br>
this rascal, I could brain him with his lady's fan. <br>
Is there not my father, my uncle and myself? lord<br>
Edmund Mortimer, My lord of York and Owen Glendower?<br>
is there not besides the Douglas? have I not all<br>
their letters to meet me in arms by the ninth of the<br>
next month? and are they not some of them set <br>
forward already? What a pagan rascal is this! an<br>
infidel! Ha! you shall see now in very sincerity<br>
of fear and cold heart, will he to the king and lay<br>
open all our proceedings. O, I could divide myself<br>
and go to buffets, for moving such a dish of <br>
skim milk with so honourable an action! Hang him!<br>
let him tell the king: we are prepared. I will set<br>
forward to-night.
