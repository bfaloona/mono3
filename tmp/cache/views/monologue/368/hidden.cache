          Peace, you ungracious clamours! peace, rude sounds!<br>
Fools on both sides! Helen must needs be fair, <br>
When with your blood you daily paint her thus.<br>
I cannot fight upon this argument;<br>
It is too starved a subject for my sword.<br>
But Pandarus,â€”O gods, how do you plague me!<br>
I cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar; <br>
And he's as tetchy to be woo'd to woo.<br>
As she is stubborn-chaste against all suit.<br>
Tell me, Apollo, for thy Daphne's love,<br>
What Cressid is, what Pandar, and what we?<br>
Her bed is India; there she lies, a pearl: <br>
Between our Ilium and where she resides,<br>
Let it be call'd the wild and wandering flood,<br>
Ourself the merchant, and this sailing Pandar<br>
Our doubtful hope, our convoy and our bark.
