           To horse, you gallant princes! straight to horse!<br>
Do but behold yon poor and starved band, <br>
And your fair show shall suck away their souls,<br>
Leaving them but the shales and husks of men.<br>
There is not work enough for all our hands;<br>
Scarce blood enough in all their sickly veins<br>
To give each naked curtle-axe a stain, <br>
That our French gallants shall to-day draw out,<br>
And sheathe for lack of sport: let us but blow on them,<br>
The vapour of our valour will o'erturn them.<br>
'Tis positive 'gainst all exceptions, lords,<br>
That our superfluous lackeys and our peasants, <br>
Who in unnecessary action swarm<br>
About our squares of battle, were enow<br>
To purge this field of such a hilding foe,<br>
Though we upon this mountain's basis by<br>
Took stand for idle speculation: <br>
But that our honours must not. What's to say?<br>
A very little little let us do.<br>
And all is done. Then let the trumpets sound<br>
The tucket sonance and the note to mount;<br>
For our approach shall so much dare the field<br>
That England shall couch down in fear and yield.
