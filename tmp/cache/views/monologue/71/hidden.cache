      <div class="monologue_preview">
          Is this a dagger which I see before me,<br>
      The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee.<br>
      I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.<br>
      Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible <br>
      To feeling as to sight? or art thou but<br>
      A dagger of the mind, a false creation,<br>
      Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?<br>
      I see thee yet, in form as palpable<br>
      As this which now I draw. <br>
      Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going;<br>
      And such an instrument I was to use.<br>
      Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses,<br>
      Or else worth all the rest; I see thee still,<br>
      And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood, <br>
      Which was not so before. There's no such thing:<br>
      It is the bloody business which informs<br>
      Thus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one halfworld<br>
      Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse<br>
      The curtain'd sleep; witchcraft celebrates <br>
      Pale Hecate's offerings, and wither'd murder,<br>
      Alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf,<br>
      Whose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace.<br>
      With Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design<br>
      Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth,<br>
      Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear<br>
      Thy very stones prate of my whereabout,<br>
      And take the present horror from the time,<br>
      Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives:<br>
      Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.<br>
      <i>[A bell rings]</i><br>
      I go, and it is done; the bell invites me.<br>
      Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell<br>
      That summons thee to heaven or to hell. <br><br>

<i>[Exit]</i>
