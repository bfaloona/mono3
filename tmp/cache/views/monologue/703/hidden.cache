          Come, come, Lavinia; look, thy foes are bound.<br>
Sirs, stop their mouths, let them not speak to me;<br>
But let them hear what fearful words I utter. <br>
O villains, Chiron and Demetrius!<br>
Here stands the spring whom you have stain'd with mud,<br>
This goodly summer with your winter mix'd.<br>
You kill'd her husband, and for that vile fault<br>
Two of her brothers were condemn'd to death, <br>
My hand cut off and made a merry jest;<br>
Both her sweet hands, her tongue, and that more dear<br>
Than hands or tongue, her spotless chastity,<br>
Inhuman traitors, you constrain'd and forced.<br>
What would you say, if I should let you speak? <br>
Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.<br>
Hark, wretches! how I mean to martyr you.<br>
This one hand yet is left to cut your throats,<br>
Whilst that Lavinia 'tween her stumps doth hold<br>
The basin that receives your guilty blood. <br>
You know your mother means to feast with me,<br>
And calls herself Revenge, and thinks me mad:<br>
Hark, villains! I will grind your bones to dust<br>
And with your blood and it I'll make a paste,<br>
And of the paste a coffin I will rear <br>
And make two pasties of your shameful heads,<br>
And bid that strumpet, your unhallow'd dam,<br>
Like to the earth swallow her own increase.<br>
This is the feast that I have bid her to,<br>
And this the banquet she shall surfeit on; <br>
For worse than Philomel you used my daughter,<br>
And worse than Progne I will be revenged:<br>
And now prepare your throats. Lavinia, come,<br>
<i>[He cuts their throats]</i><br>
Receive the blood: and when that they are dead, <br>
Let me go grind their bones to powder small<br>
And with this hateful liquor temper it;<br>
And in that paste let their vile heads be baked.<br>
Come, come, be every one officious<br>
To make this banquet; which I wish may prove <br>
More stern and bloody than the Centaurs' feast.<br>
So, now bring them in, for I'll play the cook,<br>
And see them ready 'gainst their mother comes.
