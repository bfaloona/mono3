          Sir, by your leave: having come to Padua<br>
To gather in some debts, my son Lucentio<br>
Made me acquainted with a weighty caus<br>
Of love between your daughter and himself;<br>
And- for the good report I hear of you,<br>
And for the love he beareth to your daughter,<br>
And she to him- to stay him not too long,<br>
I am content, in a good father's care, <br>
To have him match'd; and, if you please to like<br>
No worse than I, upon some agreement<br>
Me shall you find ready and willing<br>
With one consent to have her so bestow'd;<br>
For curious I cannot be with you, <br>
Signior Baptista, of whom I hear so well.
