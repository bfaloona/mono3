           I told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking;<br>
So fun of valour that they smote the air<br>
For breathing in their faces; beat the ground<br>
For kissing of their feet; yet always bending<br>
Towards their project. Then I beat my tabour; <br>
At which, like unback'd colts, they prick'd their ears,<br>
Advanced their eyelids, lifted up their noses<br>
As they smelt music: so I charm'd their ears<br>
That calf-like they my lowing follow'd through<br>
Tooth'd briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss and thorns,<br>
Which entered their frail shins: at last I left them<br>
I' the filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell,<br>
There dancing up to the chins, that the foul lake<br>
O'erstunk their feet.
