          If that thy father live, let him repent<br>
Thou wast not made his daughter; and be thou sorry<br>
To follow Caesar in his triumph, since<br>
Thou hast been whipp'd for following him: henceforth<br>
The white hand of a lady fever thee,<br>
Shake thou to look on 't. Get thee back to Caesar,<br>
Tell him thy entertainment: look, thou say<br>
He makes me angry with him; for he seems<br>
Proud and disdainful, harping on what I am,<br>
Not what he knew I was: he makes me angry;<br>
And at this time most easy 'tis to do't,<br>
When my good stars, that were my former guides,<br>
Have empty left their orbs, and shot their fires<br>
Into the abysm of hell. If he mislike<br>
My speech and what is done, tell him he has<br>
Hipparchus, my enfranched bondman, whom<br>
He may at pleasure whip, or hang, or torture,<br>
As he shall like, to quit me: urge it thou:<br>
Hence with thy stripes, begone!
