          <B>Coriolanus.</B> Come, leave your tears: a brief farewell: the beast<br>
 With many heads butts me away. Nay, mother,<br>
 Where is your ancient courage? you were used<br>
 To say extremity was the trier of spirits;<br>
 That common chances common men could bear;<br>
 That when the sea was calm all boats alike<br>
 Show'd mastership in floating; fortune's blows,<br>
 When most struck home, being gentle wounded, craves<br>
 A noble cunning: you were used to load me <br>
 With precepts that would make invincible<br>
 The heart that conn'd them. <br>
<br>
<del><b>Virgilia.</b> O heavens! O heavens! <br>
<br>
<b>Coriolanus.</b> Nay! prithee, woman,— <br>
<br>
<b>Volumnia.</b> Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome, <br>
 And occupations perish!</del> <br>
<br>
<b>Coriolanus.</b> What, what, what!<br>
 I shall be loved when I am lack'd. Nay, mother.<br>
 Resume that spirit, when you were wont to say,<br>
 If you had been the wife of Hercules, <br>
 Six of his labours you'ld have done, and saved<br>
 Your husband so much sweat. Cominius,<br>
 Droop not; adieu. Farewell, my wife, my mother:<br>
 I'll do well yet. Thou old and true Menenius,<br>
 Thy tears are salter than a younger man's, <br>
 And venomous to thine eyes. My sometime general,<br>
 I have seen thee stem, and thou hast oft beheld<br>
 Heart-hardening spectacles; tell these sad women<br>
 'Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes,<br>
 As 'tis to laugh at 'em. My mother, you wot well <br>
 My hazards still have been your solace: and<br>
 Believe't not lightly—though I go alone,<br>
 Like to a lonely dragon, that his fen<br>
 Makes fear'd and talk'd of more than seen—your son<br>
 Will or exceed the common or be caught <br>
 With cautelous baits and practise.
