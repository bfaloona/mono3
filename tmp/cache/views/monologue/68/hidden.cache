          <b>Lady Macbeth.</b><div align='right'> Was the hope drunk</div>
      Wherein you dress'd yourself? hath it slept since?<br>
      And wakes it now, to look so green and pale<br>
      At what it did so freely? From this time <br>
      Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard<br>
      To be the same in thine own act and valour<br>
      As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that<br>
      Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life,<br>
      And live a coward in thine own esteem,<br>
      Letting 'I dare not' wait upon 'I would,'<br>
      Like the poor cat i' the adage? <br><br>

<del><b>Macbeth.</b> Prithee, peace:<br>
      I dare do all that may become a man;<br>
      Who dares do more is none. </del><br><br>

<b>Lady Macbeth.</b> What beast was't, then,<br>
      That made you break this enterprise to me?<br>
      When you durst do it, then you were a man;<br>
      And, to be more than what you were, you would<br>
      Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place <br>
      Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:<br>
      They have made themselves, and that their fitness now<br>
      Does unmake you. I have given suck, and know<br>
      How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me:<br>
      I would, while it was smiling in my face, <br>
      Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums,<br>
      And dash'd the brains out, had I so sworn as you<br>
      Have done to this.
