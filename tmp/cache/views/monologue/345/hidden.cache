          O Helicanus, strike me, honour'd sir;<br>
Give me a gash, put me to present pain;<br>
Lest this great sea of joys rushing upon me<br>
O'erbear the shores of my mortality,<br>
And drown me with their sweetness. O, come hither, <br>
Thou that beget'st him that did thee beget;<br>
Thou that wast born at sea, buried at Tarsus,<br>
And found at sea again! O Helicanus,<br>
Down on thy knees, thank the holy gods as loud<br>
As thunder threatens us: this is Marina. <br>
What was thy mother's name? tell me but that,<br>
For truth can never be confirm'd enough,<br>
Though doubts did ever sleep.
