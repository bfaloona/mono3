          <div align=right>O, sir, content you;</div>
I follow him to serve my turn upon him:<br>
We cannot all be masters, nor all masters<br>
Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark <br>
Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,<br>
That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,<br>
Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,<br>
For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd:<br>
Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are <br>
Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,<br>
Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,<br>
And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,<br>
Do well thrive by them and when they have lined their coats<br>
Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;<br>
And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,<br>
It is as sure as you are Roderigo,<br>
Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:<br>
In following him, I follow but myself; <br>
Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,<br>
But seeming so, for my peculiar end:<br>
For when my outward action doth demonstrate<br>
The native act and figure of my heart<br>
In compliment extern, 'tis not long after<br>
But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve<br>
For daws to peck at: I am not what I am. <br>
