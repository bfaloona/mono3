<b>Malvolio.</b> Lady, you have. Pray you, peruse that letter.<br>
      You must not now deny it is your hand:<br>
      Write from it, if you can, in hand or phrase;<br>
      Or say 'tis not your seal, nor your invention:<br>
      You can say none of this: well, grant it then<br>
      And tell me, in the modesty of honour,<br>
      Why you have given me such clear lights of favour,<br>
      Bade me come smiling and cross-garter'd to you,<br>
      To put on yellow stockings and to frown <br>
      Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people;<br>
      And, acting this in an obedient hope,<br>
      Why have you suffer'd me to be imprison'd,<br>
      Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest,<br>
      And made the most notorious geck and gull <br>
      That e'er invention play'd on? tell me why.
