Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.<br>
The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,<br>
But that the sea, mounting to the welkin's cheek,<br>
Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered<br>
With those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel,<br>
Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,<br>
Dash'd all to pieces. O, the cry did knock<br>
Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish'd.<br>
Had I been any god of power, I would<br>
Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere <br>
It should the good ship so have swallow'd and<br>
The fraughting souls within her.
