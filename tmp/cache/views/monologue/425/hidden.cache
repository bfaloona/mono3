          You are well encount'red here, my cousin Mowbray.<br>
Good day to you, gentle Lord Archbishop;<br>
And so to you, Lord Hastings, and to all.<br>
My Lord of York, it better show'd with you<br>
When that your flock, assembled by the bell,<br>
Encircled you to hear with reverence<br>
Your exposition on the holy text<br>
Than now to see you here an iron man,<br>
Cheering a rout of rebels with your drum,<br>
Turning the word to sword, and life to death.<br>
That man that sits within a monarch's heart<br>
And ripens in the sunshine of his favour,<br>
Would he abuse the countenance of the king,<br>
Alack, what mischiefs might he set abroach<br>
In shadow of such greatness! With you, Lord Bishop,<br>
It is even so. Who hath not heard it spoken<br>
How deep you were within the books of God?<br>
To us the speaker in His parliament,<br>
To us th' imagin'd voice of God himself,<br>
The very opener and intelligencer<br>
Between the grace, the sanctities of heaven,<br>
And our dull workings. O, who shall believe<br>
But you misuse the reverence of your place,<br>
Employ the countenance and grace of heav'n<br>
As a false favourite doth his prince's name,<br>
In deeds dishonourable? You have ta'en up,<br>
Under the counterfeited zeal of God,<br>
The subjects of His substitute, my father,<br>
And both against the peace of heaven and him<br>
Have here up-swarm'd them.
