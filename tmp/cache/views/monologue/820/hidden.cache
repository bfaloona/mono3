I do perceive here a divided duty:<br>
To you I am bound for life and education;<br>
My life and education both do learn me<br>
How to respect you; you are the lord of duty;<br>
I am hitherto your daughter: but here's my husband,<br>
And so much duty as my mother show'd<br>
To you, preferring you before her father,<br>
So much I challenge that I may profess<br>
Due to the Moor my lord.<br>
