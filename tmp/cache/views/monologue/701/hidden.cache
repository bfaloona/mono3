      <div class="monologue_preview">
          Renowned Lucius, from our troops I stray'd<br>
To gaze upon a ruinous monastery;<br>
And, as I earnestly did fix mine eye<br>
Upon the wasted building, suddenly<br>
I heard a child cry underneath a wall.<br>
I made unto the noise; when soon I heard<br>
The crying babe controll'd with this discourse:<br>
'Peace, tawny slave, half me and half thy dam!<br>
Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art, <br>
Had nature lent thee but thy mother's look,<br>
Villain, thou mightst have been an emperor:<br>
But where the bull and cow are both milk-white,<br>
They never do beget a coal-black calf.<br>
Peace, villain, peace!'â€”even thus he rates the babe,â€”<br>
'For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth;<br>
Who, when he knows thou art the empress' babe,<br>
Will hold thee dearly for thy mother's sake.'<br>
With this, my weapon drawn, I rush'd upon him, <br>
Surprised him suddenly, and brought him hither,<br>
To use as you think needful of the man.
