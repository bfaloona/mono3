      And what is mine my love shall render him.<br>
      And she is mine, and all my right of her<br>
      I do estate unto Demetrius. </del><br><br>

<b>Lysander.</b> I am, my lord, as well derived as he,<br>
      As well possess'd; my love is more than his; <br>
      My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd,<br>
      If not with vantage, as Demetrius';<br>
      And, which is more than all these boasts can be,<br>
      I am beloved of beauteous Hermia:<br>
      Why should not I then prosecute my right? <br>
      Demetrius, I'll avouch it to his head,<br>
      Made love to Nedar's daughter, Helena,<br>
      And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,<br>
      Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,<br>
      Upon this spotted and inconstant man.
