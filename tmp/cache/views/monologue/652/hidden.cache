          <b>Iago.</b> Do thou meet me presently at the harbour. Come
      hither. If thou be'st valiant,— as, they say, base
      men being in love have then a nobility in their
      natures more than is native to them—list me. The
      lieutenant tonight watches on the court of 
      guard:—first, I must tell thee this—Desdemona is
      directly in love with him.
<br><br>
    <del><b>Roderigo.</b> With him! why, 'tis not possible.</del> 
<br><br>
    <B>Iago.</b> Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed.
      Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor, 
      but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies:
      and will she love him still for prating? let not
      thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed;
      and what delight shall she have to look on the
      devil? When the blood is made dull with the act of
      sport, there should be, again to inflame it and to      give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favour,
      sympathy in years, manners and beauties; all which
      the Moor is defective in: now, for want of these
      required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will 
      find itself abused, begin to heave the gorge,
      disrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature will
      instruct her in it and compel her to some second
      choice. Now, sir, this granted,—as it is a most
      pregnant and unforced position—who stands so 
      eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio
      does? a knave very voluble; no further
      conscionable than in putting on the mere form of
      civil and humane seeming, for the better compassing
      of his salt and most hidden loose affection? why,
      none; why, none: a slipper and subtle knave, a
      finder of occasions, that has an eye can stamp and
      counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never
      present itself; a devilish knave. Besides, the
      knave is handsome, young, and hath all those 
      requisites in him that folly and green minds look
      after: a pestilent complete knave; and the woman
      hath found him already.
