      <div class="monologue_preview">
          The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,<br>
Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,<br>
And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels<br>
From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:<br>
Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,<br>
The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,<br>
I must up-fill this osier cage of ours<br>
With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.<br>
The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;<br>
What is her burying grave that is her womb,<br>
And from her womb children of divers kind<br>
We sucking on her natural bosom find, <br>
Many for many virtues excellent,<br>
None but for some and yet all different.<br>
O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies<br>
In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:<br>
For nought so vile that on the earth doth live <br>
But to the earth some special good doth give,<br>
Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use<br>
Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:<br>
Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;<br>
And vice sometimes by action dignified.<br>
Within the infant rind of this small flower<br>
Poison hath residence and medicine power:<br>
For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;<br>
Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.<br>
Two such opposed kings encamp them still <br>
In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;<br>
And where the worser is predominant,<br>
Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
