          O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow'd my daughter?<br>
Damn'd as thou art, thou hast enchanted her;<br>
For I'll refer me to all things of sense,<br>
If she in chains of magic were not bound,<br>
Whether a maid so tender, fair and happy,<br>
So opposite to marriage that she shunned<br>
The wealthy curled darlings of our nation,<br>
Would ever have, to incur a general mock,<br>
Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom <br>
Of such a thing as thou, to fear, not to delight.<br>
Judge me the world, if 'tis not gross in sense<br>
That thou hast practised on her with foul charms,<br>
Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals<br>
That weaken motion: I'll have't disputed on; <br>
'Tis probable and palpable to thinking.<br>
I therefore apprehend and do attach thee<br>
For an abuser of the world, a practiser<br>
Of arts inhibited and out of warrant.<br>
Lay hold upon him: if he do resist, <br>
Subdue him at his peril. <br>
