          I am near to the place where they should meet, if <br>
      Pisanio have mapped it truly. How fit his garments<br>
      serve me! Why should his mistress, who was made by<br>
      him that made the tailor, not be fit too? the <br>
      rather.saving reverence of the word.for 'tis said<br>
      a woman's fitness comes by fits. Therein I must<br>
      play the workman. I dare speak it to myself.for it<br>
      is not vain-glory for a man and his glass to confer<br>
      in his own chamber.I mean, the lines of my body are
      as well drawn as his; no less young, more strong,<br>
      not beneath him in fortunes, beyond him in the<br>
      advantage of the time, above him in birth, alike<br>
      conversant in general services, and more remarkable<br>
      in single oppositions: yet this imperceiverant<br>
      thing loves him in my despite. What mortality is!<br>
      Posthumus, thy head, which now is growing upon thy<br>
      shoulders, shall within this hour be off; thy<br>
      mistress enforced; thy garments cut to pieces before<br>
      thy face: and all this done, spurn her home to her<br>
      father; who may haply be a little angry for my so<br>
      rough usage; but my mother, having power of his<br>
      testiness, shall turn all into my commendations. My<br>
      horse is tied up safe: out, sword, and to a sore<br>
      purpose! Fortune, put them into my hand! This is<br>
      the very description of their meeting-place; and<br>
      the fellow dares not deceive me. <br>
