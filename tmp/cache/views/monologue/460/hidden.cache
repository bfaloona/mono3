          In which array, brave soldier, doth he lie,<br>
Larding the plain; and by his bloody side,<br>
Yoke-fellow to his honour-owing wounds, <br>
The noble Earl of Suffolk also lies.<br>
Suffolk first died: and York, all haggled over,<br>
Comes to him, where in gore he lay insteep'd,<br>
And takes him by the beard; kisses the gashes<br>
That bloodily did spawn upon his face; <br>
And cries aloud 'Tarry, dear cousin Suffolk!<br>
My soul shall thine keep company to heaven;<br>
Tarry, sweet soul, for mine, then fly abreast,<br>
As in this glorious and well-foughten field<br>
We kept together in our chivalry!' <br>
Upon these words I came and cheer'd him up:<br>
He smiled me in the face, raught me his hand,<br>
And, with a feeble gripe, says 'Dear my lord,<br>
Commend my service to me sovereign.'<br>
So did he turn and over Suffolk's neck <br>
He threw his wounded arm and kiss'd his lips;<br>
And so espoused to death, with blood he seal'd<br>
A testament of noble-ending love.<br>
The pretty and sweet manner of it forced<br>
Those waters from me which I would have stopp'd; <br>
But I had not so much of man in me,<br>
And all my mother came into mine eyes<br>
And gave me up to tears.
