A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife;<br>
That never set a squadron in the field,<br>
Nor the division of a battle knows<br>
More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,<br>

As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise,<br>
Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election:<br>
And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof<br>
At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds<br>
Christian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd <br>
By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,<br>

Still question'd me the story of my life,<br>
From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes, <br>
That I have passed.<br>
I ran it through, even from my boyish days,<br>
To the very moment that he bade me tell it;<br>
Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,<br>
Of moving accidents by flood and field <br>
Of hair-breadth scapes i' the imminent deadly breach,<br>
Of being taken by the insolent foe<br>
And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence<br>
And portance in my travels' history:<br>
Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,<br>
Rough quarries, rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven<br>
It was my hint to speak,â€”such was the process;<br>
And of the Cannibals that each other eat,<br>
The Anthropophagi and men whose heads<br>
Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear <br>
Would Desdemona seriously incline:<br>
But still the house-affairs would draw her thence:<br>
Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,<br>
She'ld come again, and with a greedy ear<br>
Devour up my discourse: which I observing, <br>
Took once a pliant hour, and found good means<br>
To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart<br>
That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,<br>
Whereof by parcels she had something heard,<br>
But not intentively: I did consent, <br>
And often did beguile her of her tears,<br>
When I did speak of some distressful stroke<br>
That my youth suffer'd. My story being done,<br>
She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:<br>
She swore, in faith, twas strange, 'twas passing strange, <br>
'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful:<br>
She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd<br>
That heaven had made her such a man: she thank'd me,<br>
And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,<br>
I should but teach him how to tell my story. <br>
And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:<br>
She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd,<br>
And I loved her that she did pity them.<br>
This only is the witchcraft I have used:<br>
Here comes the lady; let her witness it. <br>

      Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor, 
      but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies:
      and will she love him still for prating? let not
      thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed;
      and what delight shall she have to look on the
      devil? When the blood is made dull with the act of
      sport, there should be, again to inflame it and to      give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favour,
      sympathy in years, manners and beauties; all which
      the Moor is defective in: now, for want of these
      required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will 
      find itself abused, begin to heave the gorge,
      disrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature will
      instruct her in it and compel her to some second
      choice. Now, sir, this granted,â€”as it is a most
      pregnant and unforced positionâ€”who stands so 
      eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio
      does? a knave very voluble; no further
      conscionable than in putting on the mere form of
      civil and humane seeming, for the better compassing
      of his salt and most hidden loose affection? why,
      none; why, none: a slipper and subtle knave, a
      finder of occasions, that has an eye can stamp and
      counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never
      present itself; a devilish knave. Besides, the
      knave is handsome, young, and hath all those 
      requisites in him that folly and green minds look
      after: a pestilent complete knave; and the woman
      hath found him already.
