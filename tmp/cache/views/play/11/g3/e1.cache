          What a damned Epicurean rascal is this! My heart is
ready to crack with impatience. Who says this is
improvident jealousy? my wife hath sent to him; the
hour is fixed; the match is made. Would any man
have thought this? See the hell of having a false
woman! My bed shall be abused, my coffers
ransacked, my reputation gnawn at; and I shall not
only receive this villanous wrong, but stand under 
the adoption of abominable terms, and by him that
does me this wrong. Terms! names! Amaimon sounds
well; Lucifer, well; Barbason, well; yet they are
devils' additions, the names of fiends: but
Cuckold! Wittol!—Cuckold! the devil himself hath
not such a name. Page is an ass, a secure ass: he
will trust his wife; he will not be jealous. I will
rather trust a Fleming with my butter, Parson Hugh
the Welshman with my cheese, an Irishman with my
aqua-vitae bottle, or a thief to walk my ambling
gelding, than my wife with herself; then she plots,
then she ruminates, then she devises; and what they
think in their hearts they may effect, they will
break their hearts but they will effect. God be
praised for my jealousy! Eleven o'clock the hour.
I will prevent this, detect my wife, be revenged on
Falstaff, and laugh at Page. I will about it;
better three hours too soon than a minute too late.
Fie, fie, fie! cuckold! cuckold! cuckold!

Thames? Well, if I be served such another trick,
I'll have my brains ta'en out and buttered, and give
them to a dog for a new-year's gift. The rogues
slighted me into the river with as little remorse as
they would have drowned a blind bitch's puppies,
fifteen i' the litter: and you may know by my size
that I have a kind of alacrity in sinking; if the

           Nay, you shall hear, Master Brook, what I have
suffered to bring this woman to evil for your good.
Being thus crammed in the basket, a couple of Ford's
knaves, his hinds, were called forth by their
mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to
Datchet-lane: they took me on their shoulders; met
the jealous knave their master in the door, who
asked them once or twice what they had in their
basket: I quaked for fear, lest the lunatic knave
would have searched it; but fate, ordaining he
should be a cuckold, held his hand. Well: on went he
for a search, and away went I for foul clothes. But
mark the sequel, Master Brook: I suffered the pangs
of three several deaths; first, an intolerable
fright, to be detected with a jealous rotten
bell-wether; next, to be compassed, like a good
bilbo, in the circumference of a peck, hilt to
point, heel to head; and then, to be stopped in,
like a strong distillation, with stinking clothes
that fretted in their own grease: think of that,—a
man of my kidney,—think of that,—that am as subject
to heat as butter; a man of continual dissolution
and thaw: it was a miracle to scape suffocation.
And in the height of this bath, when I was more than
half stewed in grease, like a Dutch dish, to be
thrown into the Thames, and cooled, glowing hot,
in that surge, like a horse-shoe; think of
that,—hissing hot,—think of that, Master Brook.

With the dear love I bear to fair Anne Page;<br>
Who mutually hath answer'd my affection,<br>
So far forth as herself might be her chooser,<br>
Even to my wish: I have a letter from her<br>
Of such contents as you will wonder at; <br>
The mirth whereof so larded with my matter,<br>
That neither singly can be manifested,<br>
Without the show of both; fat Falstaff<br>
Hath a great scene: the image of the jest<br>
I'll show you here at large. Hark, good mine host. <br>
To-night at Herne's oak, just 'twixt twelve and one,<br>
Must my sweet Nan present the Fairy Queen;<br>
The purpose why, is here: in which disguise,<br>
While other jests are something rank on foot,<br>
Her father hath commanded her to slip <br>
Away with Slender and with him at Eton<br>
Immediately to marry: she hath consented: Now, sir,<br>
Her mother, ever strong against that match<br>
And firm for Doctor Caius, hath appointed<br>
That he shall likewise shuffle her away, <br>
While other sports are tasking of their minds,<br>
And at the deanery, where a priest attends,<br>
Straight marry her: to this her mother's plot<br>
She seemingly obedient likewise hath<br>
Made promise to the doctor. Now, thus it rests:<br>
Her father means she shall be all in white,<br>
And in that habit, when Slender sees his time<br>
To take her by the hand and bid her go,<br>
She shall go with him: her mother hath intended,<br>
The better to denote her to the doctor, <br>
For they must all be mask'd and vizarded,<br>
That quaint in green she shall be loose enrobed,<br>
With ribands pendent, flaring 'bout her head;<br>
And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe,<br>
To pinch her by the hand, and, on that token,<br>
The maid hath given consent to go with him.
