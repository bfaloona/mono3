          What, have I scaped love-letters in the holiday-<br>
time of my beauty, and am I now a subject for them?<br>
Let me see.<br>
[Reads]<br>
'Ask me no reason why I love you; for though<br>
Love use Reason for his physician, he admits him<br>
not for his counsellor. You are not young, no more<br>
am I; go to then, there's sympathy: you are merry, <br>
so am I; ha, ha! then there's more sympathy: you<br>
love sack, and so do I; would you desire better<br>
sympathy? Let it suffice thee, Mistress Page,—at<br>
the least, if the love of soldier can suffice,—<br>
that I love thee. I will not say, pity me; 'tis <br>
not a soldier-like phrase: but I say, love me. By me,<br>
Thine own true knight,<br>
By day or night,<br>
Or any kind of light,<br>
With all his might <br>
For thee to fight, JOHN FALSTAFF'<br>
What a Herod of Jewry is this! O wicked<br>
world! One that is well-nigh worn to pieces with<br>
age to show himself a young gallant! What an<br>
unweighed behavior hath this Flemish drunkard<br>
picked—with the devil's name!—out of my<br>
conversation, that he dares in this manner assay me?<br>
Why, he hath not been thrice in my company! What<br>
should I say to him? I was then frugal of my<br>
mirth: Heaven forgive me! Why, I'll exhibit a bill<br>
in the parliament for the putting down of men. How<br>
shall I be revenged on him? for revenged I will be,<br>
as sure as his guts are made of puddings.

might be knighted. I shall think the worse of fat
men, as long as I have an eye to make difference of
men's liking: and yet he would not swear; praised 
women's modesty; and gave such orderly and
well-behaved reproof to all uncomeliness, that I
would have sworn his disposition would have gone to
the truth of his words; but they do no more adhere
and keep place together than the Hundredth Psalm to
the tune of 'Green Sleeves.' What tempest, I trow,
threw this whale, with so many tuns of oil in his
belly, ashore at Windsor? How shall I be revenged
on him? I think the best way were to entertain him
with hope, till the wicked fire of lust have melted
him in his own grease. Did you ever hear the like?

have brought her into such a canaries as 'tis
wonderful. The best courtier of them all, when the 
court lay at Windsor, could never have brought her
to such a canary. Yet there has been knights, and
lords, and gentlemen, with their coaches, I warrant
you, coach after coach, letter after letter, gift
after gift; smelling so sweetly, all musk, and so 
rushling, I warrant you, in silk and gold; and in
such alligant terms; and in such wine and sugar of
the best and the fairest, that would have won any
woman's heart; and, I warrant you, they could never
get an eye-wink of her: I had myself twenty angels
given me this morning; but I defy all angels, in
any such sort, as they say, but in the way of
honesty: and, I warrant you, they could never get
her so much as sip on a cup with the proudest of
them all: and yet there has been earls, nay, which 
is more, pensioners; but, I warrant you, all is one with her.

Sometime a keeper here in Windsor forest,<br>
Doth all the winter-time, at still midnight,<br>
Walk round about an oak, with great ragg'd horns;<br>
And there he blasts the tree and takes the cattle<br>
And makes milch-kine yield blood and shakes a chain<br>
In a most hideous and dreadful manner:<br>
You have heard of such a spirit, and well you know<br>
The superstitious idle-headed eld<br>
Received and did deliver to our age<br>
This tale of Herne the hunter for a truth.
