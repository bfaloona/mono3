Ambitiously for rule and empery,<br>
Know that the people of Rome, for whom we stand<br>
A special party, have, by common voice,<br>
In election for the Roman empery,<br>
Chosen Andronicus, surnamed Pius<br>
For many good and great deserts to Rome:<br>
A nobler man, a braver warrior, <br>
Lives not this day within the city walls:<br>
He by the senate is accit'd home<br>
From weary wars against the barbarous Goths;<br>
That, with his sons, a terror to our foes,<br>
Hath yoked a nation strong, train'd up in arms. <br>
Ten years are spent since first he undertook<br>
This cause of Rome and chastised with arms<br>
Our enemies' pride: five times he hath return'd<br>
Bleeding to Rome, bearing his valiant sons<br>
In coffins from the field; <br>
And now at last, laden with horror's spoils,<br>
Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,<br>
Renowned Titus, flourishing in arms.<br>
Let us entreat, by honour of his name,<br>
Whom worthily you would have now succeed. <br>
And in the Capitol and senate's right,<br>
Whom you pretend to honour and adore,<br>
That you withdraw you and abate your strength;<br>
Dismiss your followers and, as suitors should,<br>
Plead your deserts in peace and humbleness.

Fitted by kind for rape and villany:<br>
Single you thither then this dainty doe,<br>
And strike her home by force, if not by words: <br>
This way, or not at all, stand you in hope.<br>
Come, come, our empress, with her sacred wit<br>
To villany and vengeance consecrate,<br>
Will we acquaint with all that we intend;<br>
And she shall file our engines with advice, <br>
That will not suffer you to square yourselves,<br>
But to your wishes' height advance you both.<br>
The emperor's court is like the house of Fame,<br>
The palace full of tongues, of eyes, and ears:<br>
The woods are ruthless, dreadful, deaf, and dull; <br>
There speak, and strike, brave boys, and take your turns;<br>
There serve your lusts, shadow'd from heaven's eye,<br>

Speak, gentle niece, what stern ungentle hands <br>
Have lopp'd and hew'd and made thy body bare<br>
Of her two branches, those sweet ornaments,<br>
Whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in,<br>
And might not gain so great a happiness<br>
As have thy love? Why dost not speak to me? <br>
Alas, a crimson river of warm blood,<br>
Like to a bubbling fountain stirr'd with wind,<br>
Doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips,<br>
Coming and going with thy honey breath.<br>
But, sure, some Tereus hath deflowered thee,<br>
And, lest thou shouldst detect him, cut thy tongue.<br>
Ah, now thou turn'st away thy face for shame!<br>
And, notwithstanding all this loss of blood,<br>
As from a conduit with three issuing spouts,<br>
Yet do thy cheeks look red as Titan's face <br>
Blushing to be encountered with a cloud.<br>
Shall I speak for thee? shall I say 'tis so?<br>
O, that I knew thy heart; and knew the beast,<br>
That I might rail at him, to ease my mind!<br>
Sorrow concealed, like an oven stopp'd, <br>
Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is.<br>
Fair Philomela, she but lost her tongue,<br>
And in a tedious sampler sew'd her mind:<br>
But, lovely niece, that mean is cut from thee;<br>
A craftier Tereus, cousin, hast thou met,<br>
And he hath cut those pretty fingers off,<br>
That could have better sew'd than Philomel.<br>
O, had the monster seen those lily hands<br>
Tremble, like aspen-leaves, upon a lute,<br>
And make the silken strings delight to kiss them, <br>
He would not then have touch'd them for his life!<br>
Or, had he heard the heavenly harmony<br>
Which that sweet tongue hath made,<br>
He would have dropp'd his knife, and fell asleep<br>
As Cerberus at the Thracian poet's feet. <br>
Come, let us go, and make thy father blind;<br>
For such a sight will blind a father's eye:<br>
One hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads;<br>
What will whole months of tears thy father's eyes?<br>
Do not draw back, for we will mourn with thee <br>
O, could our mourning ease thy misery!

 And thou, and I, sit round about some fountain,<br>
 Looking all downwards to behold our cheeks<br>
 How they are stain'd, as meadows, yet not dry, <br>
 With miry slime left on them by a flood?<br>
 And in the fountain shall we gaze so long<br>
 Till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness,<br>
 And made a brine-pit with our bitter tears?<br>
 Or shall we cut away our hands, like thine? <br>
 Or shall we bite our tongues, and in dumb shows<br>
 Pass the remainder of our hateful days?<br>
 What shall we do? let us, that have our tongues,<br>
 Plot some deuce of further misery,<br>
 To make us wonder'd at in time to come.

 Accuse some innocent and forswear myself, <br>
 Set deadly enmity between two friends,<br>
 Make poor men's cattle break their necks;<br>
 Set fire on barns and hay-stacks in the night,<br>
 And bid the owners quench them with their tears.<br>
 Oft have I digg'd up dead men from their graves, <br>
 And set them upright at their dear friends' doors,<br>
 Even when their sorrows almost were forgot;<br>
 And on their skins, as on the bark of trees,<br>
 Have with my knife carved in Roman letters,<br>
 'Let not your sorrow die, though I am dead.' <br>
 Tut, I have done a thousand dreadful things<br>

          You sad-faced men, people and sons of Rome, <br>
By uproar sever'd, like a flight of fowl<br>
Scatter'd by winds and high tempestuous gusts,<br>
O, let me teach you how to knit again<br>
This scatter'd corn into one mutual sheaf,<br>
These broken limbs again into one body; <br>
Lest Rome herself be bane unto herself,<br>
And she whom mighty kingdoms court'sy to,<br>
Like a forlorn and desperate castaway,<br>
Do shameful execution on herself.<br>
But if my frosty signs and chaps of age,<br>
Grave witnesses of true experience,<br>
Cannot induce you to attend my words,<br>
<i>[To LUCIUS]</i><br>
Speak, Rome's dear friend, as erst our ancestor,<br>
When with his solemn tongue he did discourse <br>
To love-sick Dido's sad attending ear<br>
The story of that baleful burning night<br>
When subtle Greeks surprised King Priam's Troy,<br>
Tell us what Sinon hath bewitch'd our ears,<br>
Or who hath brought the fatal engine in <br>
That gives our Troy, our Rome, the civil wound.<br>
My heart is not compact of flint nor steel;<br>
Nor can I utter all our bitter grief,<br>
But floods of tears will drown my oratory,<br>
And break my utterance, even in the time<br>
When it should move you to attend me most,<br>
Lending your kind commiseration.<br>
Here is a captain, let him tell the tale;<br>
Your hearts will throb and weep to hear him speak.

          Then, noble auditory, be it known to you, <br>
That cursed Chiron and Demetrius<br>
Were they that murdered our emperor's brother;<br>
And they it were that ravished our sister:<br>
For their fell faults our brothers were beheaded;<br>
Our father's tears despised, and basely cozen'd <br>
Of that true hand that fought Rome's quarrel out,<br>
And sent her enemies unto the grave.<br>
Lastly, myself unkindly banished,<br>
The gates shut on me, and turn'd weeping out,<br>
To beg relief among Rome's enemies: <br>
Who drown'd their enmity in my true tears.<br>
And oped their arms to embrace me as a friend.<br>
I am the turned forth, be it known to you,<br>
That have preserved her welfare in my blood;<br>
And from her bosom took the enemy's point, <br>
Sheathing the steel in my adventurous body.<br>
Alas, you know I am no vaunter, I;<br>
My scars can witness, dumb although they are,<br>
That my report is just and full of truth.<br>
But, soft! methinks I do digress too much, <br>
Citing my worthless praise: O, pardon me;<br>
For when no friends are by, men praise themselves.
