How ill white hairs become a fool and jester!<br>
I have long dreamt of such a kind of man,<br>
So surfeit-swell'd, so old, and so profane;<br>
But being awak'd, I do despise my dream.<br>
Make less thy body hence, and more thy grace; <br>

That I have turn'd away my former self;<br>
So will I those that kept me company.<br>
When thou dost hear I am as I have been,<br>
Approach me, and thou shalt be as thou wast,<br>
The tutor and the feeder of my riots. <br>
Till then I banish thee, on pain of death,<br>
As I have done the rest of my misleaders,<br>
Not to come near our person by ten mile.<br>
For competence of life I will allow you,<br>
That lack of means enforce you not to evils; <br>
And, as we hear you do reform yourselves,<br>
We will, according to your strengths and qualities,<br>
Give you advancement. Be it your charge, my lord,<br>
To see perform'd the tenour of our word.<br>
Set on. <i>[Exeunt the KING and his train]</i>

          Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,<br>
That owe yourselves, your lives and services<br>
To this imperial throne. There is no bar<br>
To make against your highness' claim to France<br>
But this, which they produce from Pharamond,<br>
'In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant:'<br>
'No woman shall succeed in Salique land:'<br>
Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze <br>
To be the realm of France, and Pharamond<br>
The founder of this law and female bar.<br>
Yet their own authors faithfully affirm<br>
That the land Salique is in Germany,<br>
Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe; <br>
Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,<br>
There left behind and settled certain French;<br>
Who, holding in disdain the German women<br>
For some dishonest manners of their life,<br>
Establish'd then this law; to wit, no female <br>
Should be inheritrix in Salique land:<br>
Which Salique, as I said, 'twixt Elbe and Sala,<br>
Is at this day in Germany call'd Meisen.<br>
Then doth it well appear that Salique law<br>
Was not devised for the realm of France: <br>
Nor did the French possess the Salique land<br>
Until four hundred one and twenty years<br>
After defunction of King Pharamond,<br>
Idly supposed the founder of this law;<br>
Who died within the year of our redemption <br>
Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great<br>
Subdued the Saxons, and did seat the French<br>
Beyond the river Sala, in the year<br>
Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,<br>
King Pepin, which deposed Childeric, <br>
Did, as heir general, being descended<br>
Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,<br>
Make claim and title to the crown of France.<br>
Hugh Capet also, who usurped the crown<br>
Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male <br>
Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,<br>
To find his title with some shows of truth,<br>
'Through, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught,<br>
Convey'd himself as heir to the Lady Lingare,<br>
Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son <br>
To Lewis the emperor, and Lewis the son<br>
Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,<br>
Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,<br>
Could not keep quiet in his conscience,<br>
Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied <br>
That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,<br>
Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,<br>
Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine:<br>
By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great<br>
Was re-united to the crown of France. <br>
So that, as clear as is the summer's sun.<br>
King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,<br>
King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear<br>
To hold in right and title of the female:<br>
So do the kings of France unto this day; <br>
Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law<br>
To bar your highness claiming from the female,<br>
And rather choose to hide them in a net<br>
Than amply to imbar their crooked titles<br>
Usurp'd from you and your progenitors.

The state of man in divers functions, <br>
Setting endeavour in continual motion;<br>
To which is fixed, as an aim or butt,<br>
Obedience: for so work the honey-bees,<br>
Creatures that by a rule in nature teach<br>
The act of order to a peopled kingdom.<br>
They have a king and officers of sorts;<br>
Where some, like magistrates, correct at home,<br>
Others, like merchants, venture trade abroad,<br>
Others, like soldiers, armed in their stings,<br>

Which pillage they with merry march bring home<br>

Who, busied in his majesty, surveys<br>
The singing masons building roofs of gold,<br>
The civil citizens kneading up the honey,<br>
The poor mechanic porters crowding in<br>
Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate,<br>
The sad-eyed justice, with his surly hum,<br>
Delivering o'er to executors pale<br>
The lazy yawning drone. I this infer, <br>
That many things, having full reference<br>
To one consent, may work contrariously:<br>
As many arrows, loosed several ways,<br>
Come to one mark; as many ways meet in one town;<br>
As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea; <br>
As many lines close in the dial's centre;<br>
So may a thousand actions, once afoot.<br>
End in one purpose, and be all well borne<br>
Without defeat. Therefore to France, my liege.<br>
Divide your happy England into four; <br>
Whereof take you one quarter into France,<br>
And you withal shall make all Gallia shake.<br>
If we, with thrice such powers left at home,<br>
Cannot defend our own doors from the dog,<br>
Let us be worried and our nation lose<br>
The name of hardiness and policy.

That I will dazzle all the eyes of France,<br>
Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us. <br>
And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his<br>
Hath turn'd his balls to gun-stones; and his soul<br>
Shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance<br>
That shall fly with them: for many a thousand widows<br>
Shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands; <br>
Mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down;<br>

Tell you the Dauphin I am coming on,<br>
To venge me as I may and to put forth<br>
My rightful hand in a well-hallow'd cause.<br>
So get you hence in peace; and tell the Dauphin<br>
His jest will savour but of shallow wit,<br>

With crowns imperial, crowns and coronets,<br>
Promised to Harry and his followers.<br>
The French, advised by good intelligence <br>
Of this most dreadful preparation,<br>
Shake in their fear and with pale policy<br>
Seek to divert the English purposes.<br>
O England! model to thy inward greatness,<br>
Like little body with a mighty heart, <br>
What mightst thou do, that honour would thee do,<br>
Were all thy children kind and natural!<br>
But see thy fault! France hath in thee found out<br>
A nest of hollow bosoms, which he fills<br>
With treacherous crowns; and three corrupted men, <br>
One, Richard Earl of Cambridge, and the second,<br>
Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, and the third,<br>
Sir Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland,<br>
Have, for the gilt of France,â€”O guilt indeed!<br>
Confirm'd conspiracy with fearful France; <br>
And by their hands this grace of kings must die,<br>
If hell and treason hold their promises,<br>
Ere he take ship for France, and in Southampton.<br>
Linger your patience on; and we'll digest<br>
The abuse of distance; force a play: <br>
The sum is paid; the traitors are agreed;<br>
The king is set from London; and the scene<br>
Is now transported, gentles, to Southampton;<br>
There is the playhouse now, there must you sit:<br>
And thence to France shall we convey you safe, <br>
And bring you back, charming the narrow seas<br>
To give you gentle pass; for, if we may,<br>
We'll not offend one stomach with our play.<br>
But, till the king come forth, and not till then,<br>
Unto Southampton do we shift our scene.

           The mercy that was quick in us but late, <br>
By your own counsel is suppress'd and kill'd:<br>
You must not dare, for shame, to talk of mercy;<br>
For your own reasons turn into your bosoms,<br>
As dogs upon their masters, worrying you.<br>
See you, my princes, and my noble peers, <br>
These English monsters! My Lord of Cambridge here,<br>
You know how apt our love was to accord<br>
To furnish him with all appertinents<br>
Belonging to his honour; and this man<br>
Hath, for a few light crowns, lightly conspired, <br>
And sworn unto the practises of France,<br>
To kill us here in Hampton: to the which<br>
This knight, no less for bounty bound to us<br>
Than Cambridge is, hath likewise sworn. But, O,<br>
What shall I say to thee, Lord Scroop? thou cruel,<br>
Ingrateful, savage and inhuman creature!<br>
Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels,<br>
That knew'st the very bottom of my soul,<br>
That almost mightst have coin'd me into gold,<br>
Wouldst thou have practised on me for thy use, <br>
May it be possible, that foreign hire<br>
Could out of thee extract one spark of evil<br>
That might annoy my finger? 'tis so strange,<br>
That, though the truth of it stands off as gross<br>
As black and white, my eye will scarcely see it.<br>
Treason and murder ever kept together,<br>
As two yoke-devils sworn to either's purpose,<br>
Working so grossly in a natural cause,<br>
That admiration did not whoop at them:<br>
But thou, 'gainst all proportion, didst bring in <br>
Wonder to wait on treason and on murder:<br>
And whatsoever cunning fiend it was<br>
That wrought upon thee so preposterously<br>
Hath got the voice in hell for excellence:<br>
All other devils that suggest by treasons <br>
Do botch and bungle up damnation<br>
With patches, colours, and with forms being fetch'd<br>
From glistering semblances of piety;<br>
But he that temper'd thee bade thee stand up,<br>
Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason, <br>
Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor.<br>
If that same demon that hath gull'd thee thus<br>
Should with his lion gait walk the whole world,<br>
He might return to vasty Tartar back,<br>
And tell the legions 'I can never win <br>
A soul so easy as that Englishman's.'<br>
O, how hast thou with 'jealousy infected<br>
The sweetness of affiance! Show men dutiful?<br>
Why, so didst thou: seem they grave and learned?<br>
Why, so didst thou: come they of noble family? <br>
Why, so didst thou: seem they religious?<br>
Why, so didst thou: or are they spare in diet,<br>
Free from gross passion or of mirth or anger,<br>
Constant in spirit, not swerving with the blood,<br>
Garnish'd and deck'd in modest complement, <br>
Not working with the eye without the ear,<br>
And but in purged judgment trusting neither?<br>
Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem:<br>
And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot,<br>
To mark the full-fraught man and best indued<br>
With some suspicion. I will weep for thee;<br>
For this revolt of thine, methinks, is like<br>
Another fall of man. Their faults are open:<br>
Arrest them to the answer of the law;<br>
And God acquit them of their practises!

 By law of nature and of nations, 'long<br>

 Willing to overlook this pedigree:<br>
 And when you find him evenly derived<br>
 From his most famed of famous ancestors, <br>
 Edward the Third, he bids you then resign<br>

 From him the native and true challenger. <br>

 Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming,<br>
 In thunder and in earthquake, like a Jove,<br>
 That, if requiring fail, he will compel;<br>
 And bids you, in the bowels of the Lord, <br>
 Deliver up the crown, and to take mercy<br>
 On the poor souls for whom this hungry war<br>
 Opens his vasty jaws; and on your head<br>
 Turning the widows' tears, the orphans' cries<br>
 The dead men's blood, the pining maidens groans, <br>
 For husbands, fathers and betrothed lovers,<br>
 That shall be swallow'd in this controversy.<br>

 The mighty sender, doth he prize you at.<br>
 Thus says my king; an' if your father's highness<br>
 Do not, in grant of all demands at large, <br>
 Sweeten the bitter mock you sent his majesty,<br>
 He'll call you to so hot an answer of it,<br>
 That caves and womby vaultages of France<br>
 Shall chide your trespass and return your mock<br>
 In second accent of his ordnance. <br>
<br>
<del><b>Lewis the Dauphin.</b> Say, if my father render fair return,<br>
 It is against my will; for I desire<br>
 Nothing but odds with England: to that end,<br>
 As matching to his youth and vanity,<br>
 I did present him with the Paris balls.</del> <br>
<br>
<b>Duke of Exeter.</b> He'll make your Paris Louvre shake for it,<br>
 Were it the mistress-court of mighty Europe:<br>
 And, be assured, you'll find a difference,<br>
 As we his subjects have in wonder found,<br>
 Between the promise of his greener days <br>
 And these he masters now: now he weighs time<br>
 Even to the utmost grain: that you shall read<br>
 In your own losses, if he stay in France.

A city on the inconstant billows dancing;<br>
For so appears this fleet majestical,<br>
Holding due course to Harfleur. Follow, follow:<br>
Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy, <br>
And leave your England, as dead midnight still,<br>
Guarded with grandsires, babies and old women,<br>
Either past or not arrived to pith and puissance;<br>
For who is he, whose chin is but enrich'd<br>
With one appearing hair, that will not follow<br>
These cull'd and choice-drawn cavaliers to France?<br>
Work, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege;<br>
Behold the ordnance on their carriages,<br>
With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur.<br>
Suppose the ambassador from the French comes back; <br>
Tells Harry that the king doth offer him<br>
Katharine his daughter, and with her, to dowry,<br>
Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms.<br>
The offer likes not: and the nimble gunner<br>
With linstock now the devilish cannon touches, <br>

And down goes all before them. Still be kind,<br>

swashers. I am boy to them all three: but all they
three, though they would serve me, could not be man
to me; for indeed three such antics do not amount to
a man. For Bardolph, he is white-livered and
red-faced; by the means whereof a' faces it out, but 
fights not. For Pistol, he hath a killing tongue
and a quiet sword; by the means whereof a' breaks
words, and keeps whole weapons. For Nym, he hath
heard that men of few words are the best men; and
therefore he scorns to say his prayers, lest a' 
should be thought a coward: but his few bad words
are matched with as few good deeds; for a' never
broke any man's head but his own, and that was
against a post when he was drunk. They will steal
any thing, and call it purchase. Bardolph stole a
lute-case, bore it twelve leagues, and sold it for
three half pence. Nym and Bardolph are sworn
brothers in filching, and in Calais they stole a
fire-shovel: I knew by that piece of service the
men would carry coals. They would have me as 
familiar with men's pockets as their gloves or their
handkerchers: which makes much against my manhood,
if I should take from another's pocket to put into
mine; for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs. I
must leave them, and seek some better service: 
their villany goes against my weak stomach, and
therefore I must cast it up.

As send precepts to the leviathan<br>
To come ashore. Therefore, you men of Harfleur,<br>
Take pity of your town and of your people, <br>
Whiles yet my soldiers are in my command;<br>
Whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace<br>
O'erblows the filthy and contagious clouds<br>
Of heady murder, spoil and villany.<br>
If not, why, in a moment look to see <br>
The blind and bloody soldier with foul hand<br>
Defile the locks of your shrill-shrieking daughters;<br>
Your fathers taken by the silver beards,<br>
And their most reverend heads dash'd to the walls,<br>
Your naked infants spitted upon pikes, <br>
Whiles the mad mothers with their howls confused<br>
Do break the clouds, as did the wives of Jewry<br>
At Herod's bloody-hunting slaughtermen.<br>
What say you? will you yield, and this avoid,<br>
Or, guilty in defence, be thus destroy'd?

Though we seemed dead, we did but sleep: advantage
is a better soldier than rashness. Tell him we
could have rebuked him at Harfleur, but that we
thought not good to bruise an injury till it were
full ripe: now we speak upon our cue, and our voice
is imperial: England shall repent his folly, see 
his weakness, and admire our sufferance. Bid him
therefore consider of his ransom; which must
proportion the losses we have borne, the subjects we
have lost, the disgrace we have digested; which in
weight to re-answer, his pettiness would bow under.
For our losses, his exchequer is too poor; for the
effusion of our blood, the muster of his kingdom too
faint a number; and for our disgrace, his own
person, kneeling at our feet, but a weak and
worthless satisfaction. To this add defiance: and 
tell him, for conclusion, he hath betrayed his
followers, whose condemnation is pronounced. So far
my king and master; so much my office.

Fills the wide vessel of the universe. <br>

That the fixed sentinels almost receive<br>
The secret whispers of each other's watch:<br>
Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames <br>
Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;<br>
Steed threatens steed, in high and boastful neighs<br>
Piercing the night's dull ear, and from the tents<br>
The armourers, accomplishing the knights,<br>
With busy hammers closing rivets up, <br>
Give dreadful note of preparation:<br>
The country cocks do crow, the clocks do toll,<br>
And the third hour of drowsy morning name.<br>
Proud of their numbers and secure in soul,<br>
The confident and over-lusty French <br>
Do the low-rated English play at dice;<br>
And chide the cripple tardy-gaited night<br>
Who, like a foul and ugly witch, doth limp<br>
So tediously away. The poor condemned English,<br>
Like sacrifices, by their watchful fires <br>
Sit patiently and inly ruminate<br>
The morning's danger, and their gesture sad<br>
Investing lank-lean; cheeks and war-worn coats<br>
Presenteth them unto the gazing moon<br>
So many horrid ghosts. O now, who will behold <br>
The royal captain of this ruin'd band<br>
Walking from watch to watch, from tent to tent,<br>
Let him cry 'Praise and glory on his head!'<br>
For forth he goes and visits all his host.<br>
Bids them good morrow with a modest smile <br>
And calls them brothers, friends and countrymen.<br>
Upon his royal face there is no note<br>
How dread an army hath enrounded him;<br>
Nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour<br>
Unto the weary and all-watched night, <br>
But freshly looks and over-bears attaint<br>
With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty;<br>
That every wretch, pining and pale before,<br>
Beholding him, plucks comfort from his looks:<br>
A largess universal like the sun <br>
His liberal eye doth give to every one,<br>
Thawing cold fear, that mean and gentle all,<br>
Behold, as may unworthiness define,<br>
A little touch of Harry in the night.<br>
And so our scene must to the battle fly; <br>
Whereâ€”O for pity!â€”we shall much disgrace<br>
With four or five most vile and ragged foils,<br>
Right ill-disposed in brawl ridiculous,<br>
The name of Agincourt. Yet sit and see,<br>
Minding true things by what their mockeries be.

          So, if a son that is by his father sent about
merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea, the 
imputation of his wickedness by your rule, should be
imposed upon his father that sent him: or if a
servant, under his master's command transporting a
sum of money, be assailed by robbers and die in
many irreconciled iniquities, you may call the 
business of the master the author of the servant's
damnation: but this is not so: the king is not
bound to answer the particular endings of his
soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of
his servant; for they purpose not their death, when 
they purpose their services. Besides, there is no
king, be his cause never so spotless, if it come to
the arbitrement of swords, can try it out with all
unspotted soldiers: some peradventure have on them
the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder; 
some, of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of
perjury; some, making the wars their bulwark, that
have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with
pillage and robbery. Now, if these men have
defeated the law and outrun native punishment, 
though they can outstrip men, they have no wings to
fly from God: war is his beadle, war is vengeance;
so that here men are punished for before-breach of
the king's laws in now the king's quarrel: where
they feared the death, they have borne life away;
and where they would be safe, they perish: then if
they die unprovided, no more is the king guilty of
their damnation than he was before guilty of those
impieties for the which they are now visited. Every
subject's duty is the king's; but every subject's
soul is his own. Therefore should every soldier in
the wars do as every sick man in his bed, wash every
mote out of his conscience: and dying so, death
is to him advantage; or not dying, the time was
blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained: 
and in him that escapes, it were not sin to think
that, making God so free an offer, He let him
outlive that day to see His greatness and to teach
others how they should prepare.

Sleeps in Elysium; next day after dawn,<br>

And follows so the ever-running year,<br>
With profitable labour, to his grave:<br>
And, but for ceremony, such a wretch,<br>
Winding up days with toil and nights with sleep, <br>
Had the fore-hand and vantage of a king.<br>
The slave, a member of the country's peace,<br>
Enjoys it; but in gross brain little wots<br>
What watch the king keeps to maintain the peace,<br>
Whose hours the peasant best advantages.

          What's he that wishes so?<br>
My cousin Westmoreland? No, my fair cousin:<br>
If we are mark'd to die, we are enow <br>
To do our country loss; and if to live,<br>
The fewer men, the greater share of honour.<br>
God's will! I pray thee, wish not one man more.<br>
By Jove, I am not covetous for gold,<br>
Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost; <br>
It yearns me not if men my garments wear;<br>
Such outward things dwell not in my desires:<br>
But if it be a sin to covet honour,<br>
I am the most offending soul alive.<br>
No, faith, my coz, wish not a man from England: <br>
God's peace! I would not lose so great an honour<br>
As one man more, methinks, would share from me<br>
For the best hope I have. O, do not wish one more!<br>
Rather proclaim it, Westmoreland, through my host,<br>
That he which hath no stomach to this fight, <br>
Let him depart; his passport shall be made<br>
And crowns for convoy put into his purse:<br>
We would not die in that man's company<br>
That fears his fellowship to die with us.<br>
This day is called the feast of Crispian: <br>
He that outlives this day, and comes safe home,<br>
Will stand a tip-toe when the day is named,<br>
And rouse him at the name of Crispian.<br>
He that shall live this day, and see old age,<br>
Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours, <br>
And say 'To-morrow is Saint Crispian:'<br>
Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars.<br>
And say 'These wounds I had on Crispin's day.'<br>
Old men forget: yet all shall be forgot,<br>
But he'll remember with advantages <br>
What feats he did that day: then shall our names.<br>
Familiar in his mouth as household words<br>
Harry the king, Bedford and Exeter,<br>
Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester,<br>
Be in their flowing cups freshly remember'd. <br>
This story shall the good man teach his son;<br>
And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by,<br>
From this day to the ending of the world,<br>
But we in it shall be remember'd;<br>
We few, we happy few, we band of brothers; <br>
For he to-day that sheds his blood with me<br>
Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,<br>
This day shall gentle his condition:<br>
And gentlemen in England now a-bed<br>
Shall think themselves accursed they were not here, <br>
And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks<br>
That fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day.

Let me speak proudly: tell the constable<br>
We are but warriors for the working-day;<br>
Our gayness and our gilt are all besmirch'd<br>
With rainy marching in the painful field;<br>
There's not a piece of feather in our hostâ€” <br>
Good argument, I hope, we will not flyâ€”<br>
And time hath worn us into slovenry:<br>
But, by the mass, our hearts are in the trim;<br>
And my poor soldiers tell me, yet ere night<br>
They'll be in fresher robes, or they will pluck <br>
The gay new coats o'er the French soldiers' heads<br>
And turn them out of service. If they do this,â€”<br>
As, if God please, they shall,â€”my ransom then<br>
Will soon be levied. Herald, save thou thy labour;<br>
Come thou no more for ransom, gentle herald: <br>
They shall have none, I swear, but these my joints;<br>
Which if they have as I will leave 'em them,<br>
Shall yield them little, tell the constable.

Larding the plain; and by his bloody side,<br>
Yoke-fellow to his honour-owing wounds, <br>
The noble Earl of Suffolk also lies.<br>
Suffolk first died: and York, all haggled over,<br>
Comes to him, where in gore he lay insteep'd,<br>
And takes him by the beard; kisses the gashes<br>
That bloodily did spawn upon his face; <br>
And cries aloud 'Tarry, dear cousin Suffolk!<br>
My soul shall thine keep company to heaven;<br>
Tarry, sweet soul, for mine, then fly abreast,<br>
As in this glorious and well-foughten field<br>
We kept together in our chivalry!' <br>
Upon these words I came and cheer'd him up:<br>
He smiled me in the face, raught me his hand,<br>
And, with a feeble gripe, says 'Dear my lord,<br>
Commend my service to me sovereign.'<br>
So did he turn and over Suffolk's neck <br>
He threw his wounded arm and kiss'd his lips;<br>
And so espoused to death, with blood he seal'd<br>
A testament of noble-ending love.<br>
The pretty and sweet manner of it forced<br>
Those waters from me which I would have stopp'd; <br>
But I had not so much of man in me,<br>
And all my mother came into mine eyes<br>
And gave me up to tears.

The master of the cross-bows, Lord Rambures;<br>
Great Master of France, the brave Sir Guichard Dolphin,<br>

Grandpre and Roussi, Fauconberg and Foix,<br>

Edward the Duke of York, the Earl of Suffolk,<br>
Sir Richard Ketly, Davy Gam, esquire:<br>
None else of name; and of all other men<br>

And not to us, but to thy arm alone,<br>
Ascribe we all! When, without stratagem,<br>
But in plain shock and even play of battle,<br>
Was ever known so great and little loss<br>
On one part and on the other? Take it, God, <br>
For it is none but thine!

Before him through the city: he forbids it,<br>
Being free from vainness and self-glorious pride;<br>
Giving full trophy, signal and ostent<br>
Quite from himself to God. But now behold, <br>

Go forth and fetch their conquering Caesar in:<br>
As, by a lower but loving likelihood,<br>
Were now the general of our gracious empress,<br>
As in good time he may, from Ireland coming,<br>
Bringing rebellion broached on his sword, <br>
How many would the peaceful city quit,<br>
To welcome him! much more, and much more cause,<br>
Did they this Harry. Now in London place him;<br>
As yet the lamentation of the French<br>
Invites the King of England's stay at home; <br>
The emperor's coming in behalf of France,<br>
To order peace between them; and omit<br>
All the occurrences, whatever chanced,<br>
Till Harry's back-return again to France:<br>
There must we bring him; and myself have play'd <br>
The interim, by remembering you 'tis past.<br>
Then brook abridgment, and your eyes advance,<br>
After your thoughts, straight back again to France.
