          I am sorry I should force you to believe<br>
That which I would to God I had not seen;<br>
But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state, <br>
Rend'ring faint quittance, wearied and out-breath'd,<br>
To Harry Monmouth, whose swift wrath beat down<br>
The never-daunted Percy to the earth,<br>
From whence with life he never more sprung up.<br>
In few, his deathâ€”whose spirit lent a fire <br>
Even to the dullest peasant in his campâ€”<br>
Being bruited once, took fire and heat away<br>
From the best-temper'd courage in his troops;<br>
For from his metal was his party steeled;<br>
Which once in him abated, all the rest <br>
Turn'd on themselves, like dull and heavy lead.<br>
And as the thing that's heavy in itself<br>
Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed,<br>
So did our men, heavy in Hotspur's loss,<br>
Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear <br>
That arrows fled not swifter toward their aim<br>
Than did our soldiers, aiming at their safety,<br>
Fly from the field. Then was that noble Worcester<br>
Too soon ta'en prisoner; and that furious Scot,<br>
The bloody Douglas, whose well-labouring sword <br>
Had three times slain th' appearance of the King,<br>
Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame<br>
Of those that turn'd their backs, and in his flight,<br>
Stumbling in fear, was took. The sum of all<br>
Is that the King hath won, and hath sent out <br>
A speedy power to encounter you, my lord,<br>
Under the conduct of young Lancaster<br>
And Westmoreland. This is the news at full.

You cast th' event of war, my noble lord,<br>

You were advis'd his flesh was capable <br>
Of wounds and scars, and that his forward spirit<br>
Would lift him where most trade of danger rang'd;<br>
Yet did you say 'Go forth'; and none of this,<br>
Though strongly apprehended, could restrain<br>
The stiff-borne action. What hath then befall'n, <br>
Or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth<br>
More than that being which was like to be?

My lord your son had only but the corpse, <br>
But shadows and the shows of men, to fight;<br>

The action of their bodies from their souls;<br>
And they did fight with queasiness, constrain'd,<br>
As men drink potions; that their weapons only<br>
Seem'd on our side, but for their spirits and souls<br>
This word 'rebellion'â€”it had froze them up,<br>
As fish are in a pond. But now the Bishop<br>
Turns insurrection to religion.<br>
Suppos'd sincere and holy in his thoughts, <br>
He's follow'd both with body and with mind;<br>
And doth enlarge his rising with the blood<br>
Of fair King Richard, scrap'd from Pomfret stones;<br>
Derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause;<br>
Tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land,<br>
Gasping for life under great Bolingbroke;<br>
And more and less do flock to follow him.

Nature's soft nurse, how have I frightened thee,<br>
That thou no more will weigh my eyelids down,<br>
And steep my senses in forgetfulness?<br>
Why rather, sleep, liest thou in smoky cribs,<br>
Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee,<br>
And hush'd with buzzing night-flies to thy slumber,<br>
Than in the perfum'd chambers of the great,<br>
Under the canopies of costly state,<br>
And lull'd with sound of sweetest melody?<br>
O thou dull god, why liest thou with the vile<br>
In loathsome beds, and leav'st the kingly couch<br>
A watch-case or a common 'larum-bell?<br>
Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast<br>
Seal up the ship-boy's eyes, and rock his brains<br>
In cradle of the rude imperious surge,<br>
And in the visitation of the winds,<br>
Who take the ruffian billows by the top,<br>
Curling their monstrous heads, and hanging them<br>
With deafing clamour in the slippery clouds,<br>
That with the hurly death itself awakes?<br>
Canst thou, O partial sleep, give thy repose<br>
To the wet sea-boy in an hour so rude;<br>
And in the calmest and most stillest night,<br>
With all appliances and means to boot,<br>
Deny it to a king? Then, happy low, lie down!<br>
Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.

The beachy girdle of the ocean<br>

Were they at wars. It is but eight years since<br>
This Percy was the man nearest my soul;<br>
Who like a brother toil'd in my affairs<br>
And laid his love and life under my foot;<br>
Yea, for my sake, even to the eyes of Richard<br>
Gave him defiance. But which of you was byâ€”<br>
[To WARWICK] You, cousin Nevil, as I may rememberâ€”<br>
When Richard, with his eye brim full of tears,<br>
Then check'd and rated by Northumberland,<br>
Did speak these words, now prov'd a prophecy?<br>
'Northumberland, thou ladder by the which<br>
My cousin Bolingbroke ascends my throne'â€”<br>
Though then, God knows, I had no such intent<br>
But that necessity so bow'd the state<br>
That I and greatness were compell'd to kissâ€”<br>
'The time shall come'â€”thus did he follow itâ€”<br>
'The time will come that foul sin, gathering head,<br>
Shall break into corruption' so went on,<br>
Foretelling this same time's condition<br>
And the division of our amity.

justice Shallow. Lord, Lord, how subject we old men are to this
vice of lying! This same starv'd justice hath done nothing but
prate to me of the wildness of his youth and the feats he hath
done about Turnbull Street; and every third word a lie, duer paid
to the hearer than the Turk's tribute. I do remember him at
Clement's Inn, like a man made after supper of a cheese-paring.
When 'a was naked, he was for all the world like a fork'd radish,
with a head fantastically carved upon it with a knife. 'A was so
forlorn that his dimensions to any thick sight were invisible. 'A
was the very genius of famine; yet lecherous as a monkey, and the
whores call'd him mandrake. 'A came ever in the rearward of the
fashion, and sung those tunes to the overscutch'd huswifes that
he heard the carmen whistle, and sware they were his fancies or
his good-nights. And now is this Vice's dagger become a squire,
and talks as familiarly of John a Gaunt as if he had been sworn
brother to him; and I'll be sworn 'a ne'er saw him but once in
the Tiltyard; and then he burst his head for crowding among the
marshal's men. I saw it, and told John a Gaunt he beat his own
name; for you might have thrust him and all his apparel into an
eel-skin; the case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him, a
courtâ€”and now has he land and beeves. Well, I'll be acquainted
with him if I return; and 't shall go hard but I'll make him a
philosopher's two stones to me. If the young dace be a bait for
the old pike, I see no reason in the law of nature but I may snap
at him. Let time shape, and there an end.

Briefly to this end: we are all diseas'd<br>
And with our surfeiting and wanton hours<br>
Have brought ourselves into a burning fever,<br>
And we must bleed for it; of which disease<br>
Our late King, Richard, being infected, died.<br>
But, my most noble Lord of Westmoreland,<br>
I take not on me here as a physician;<br>
Nor do I as an enemy to peace<br>
Troop in the throngs of military men;<br>
But rather show awhile like fearful war<br>
To diet rank minds sick of happiness,<br>
And purge th' obstructions which begin to stop<br>
Our very veins of life. Hear me more plainly.<br>
I have in equal balance justly weigh'd<br>
What wrongs our arms may do, what wrongs we suffer,<br>
And find our griefs heavier than our offences.<br>
We see which way the stream of time doth run<br>
And are enforc'd from our most quiet there<br>
By the rough torrent of occasion;<br>
And have the summary of all our griefs,<br>
When time shall serve, to show in articles;<br>
Which long ere this we offer'd to the King,<br>
And might by no suit gain our audience:<br>
When we are wrong'd, and would unfold our griefs,<br>
We are denied access unto his person,<br>
Even by those men that most have done us wrong.<br>
The dangers of the days but newly gone,<br>
Whose memory is written on the earth<br>
With yet appearing blood, and the examples<br>
Of every minute's instance, present now,<br>
Hath put us in these ill-beseeming arms;<br>
Not to break peace, or any branch of it,<br>
But to establish here a peace indeed,<br>
Concurring both in name and quality.

In shadow of such greatness! With you, Lord Bishop,<br>
It is even so. Who hath not heard it spoken<br>
How deep you were within the books of God?<br>
To us the speaker in His parliament,<br>
To us th' imagin'd voice of God himself,<br>
The very opener and intelligencer<br>
Between the grace, the sanctities of heaven,<br>
And our dull workings. O, who shall believe<br>
But you misuse the reverence of your place,<br>
Employ the countenance and grace of heav'n<br>
As a false favourite doth his prince's name,<br>
In deeds dishonourable? You have ta'en up,<br>

The subjects of His substitute, my father,<br>
And both against the peace of heaven and him<br>

          Open your ears; for which of you will stop<br>
The vent of hearing when loud Rumour speaks?<br>
I, from the orient to the drooping west,<br>
Making the wind my post-horse, still unfold <br>
The acts commenced on this ball of earth.<br>
Upon my tongues continual slanders ride,<br>
The which in every language I pronounce,<br>
Stuffing the ears of men with false reports.<br>
I speak of peace while covert emnity, <br>
Under the smile of safety, wounds the world;<br>
And who but Rumour, who but only I,<br>
Make fearful musters and prepar'd defence,<br>
Whiles the big year, swoln with some other grief,<br>
Is thought with child by the stern tyrant war, <br>
And no such matter? Rumour is a pipe<br>
Blown by surmises, jealousies, conjectures,<br>
And of so easy and so plain a stop<br>
That the blunt monster with uncounted heads,<br>
The still-discordant wav'ring multitude, <br>
Can play upon it. But what need I thus<br>
My well-known body to anatomize<br>
Among my household? Why is Rumour here?<br>
I run before King Harry's victory,<br>
Who, in a bloody field by Shrewsbury, <br>
Hath beaten down young Hotspur and his troops,<br>
Quenching the flame of bold rebellion<br>
Even with the rebels' blood. But what mean I<br>
To speak so true at first? My office is<br>
To noise abroad that Harry Monmouth fell <br>
Under the wrath of noble Hotspur's sword,<br>
And that the King before the Douglas' rage<br>
Stoop'd his anointed head as low as death.<br>
This have I rumour'd through the peasant towns<br>
Between that royal field of Shrewsbury<br>
And this worm-eaten hold of ragged stone,<br>
Where Hotspur's father, old Northumberland,<br>
Lies crafty-sick. The posts come tiring on,<br>
And not a man of them brings other news<br>
Than they have learnt of me. From Rumour's tongues <br>
They bring smooth comforts false, worse than true wrongs.
