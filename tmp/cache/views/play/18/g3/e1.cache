The sad companion, dull-eyed melancholy,<br>
Be my so used a guest as not an hour,<br>
In the day's glorious walk, or peaceful night, <br>
The tomb where grief should sleep, can breed me quiet?<br>
Here pleasures court mine eyes, and mine eyes shun them,<br>
And danger, which I fear'd, is at Antioch,<br>
Whose aim seems far too short to hit me here:<br>
Yet neither pleasure's art can joy my spirits, <br>
Nor yet the other's distance comfort me.<br>
Then it is thus: the passions of the mind,<br>
That have their first conception by mis-dread,<br>
Have after-nourishment and life by care;<br>
And what was first but fear what might be done,<br>
Grows elder now and cares it be not done.<br>
And so with me: the great Antiochus,<br>
'Gainst whom I am too little to contend,<br>
Since he's so great can make his will his act,<br>
Will think me speaking, though I swear to silence;<br>
Nor boots it me to say I honour him.<br>
If he suspect I may dishonour him:<br>
And what may make him blush in being known,<br>
He'll stop the course by which it might be known;<br>
With hostile forces he'll o'erspread the land, <br>
And with the ostent of war will look so huge,<br>
Amazement shall drive courage from the state;<br>
Our men be vanquish'd ere they do resist,<br>
And subjects punish'd that ne'er thought offence:<br>
Which care of them, not pity of myself, <br>
Who am no more but as the tops of trees,<br>
Which fence the roots they grow by and defend them,<br>
Makes both my body pine and soul to languish,<br>
And punish that before that he would punish.

I knew him tyrannous; and tyrants' fears<br>
Decrease not, but grow faster than the years: <br>
And should he doubt it, as no doubt he doth,<br>
That I should open to the listening air<br>
How many worthy princes' bloods were shed,<br>
To keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope,<br>
To lop that doubt, he'll fill this land with arms,<br>

Making, to take your imagination,<br>
From bourn to bourn, region to region.<br>
By you being pardon'd, we commit no crime<br>
To use one language in each several clime 1880<br>
Where our scenes seem to live. I do beseech you<br>
To learn of me, who stand i' the gaps to teach you,<br>
The stages of our story. Pericles<br>
Is now again thwarting the wayward seas,<br>
Attended on by many a lord and knight. <br>
To see his daughter, all his life's delight.<br>
Old Escanes, whom Helicanus late<br>
Advanced in time to great and high estate,<br>
Is left to govern. Bear you it in mind,<br>
Old Helicanus goes along behind. 1890<br>
Well-sailing ships and bounteous winds have brought<br>
This king to Tarsus,âthink his pilot thought;<br>
So with his steerage shall your thoughts grow on,â<br>
To fetch his daughter home, who first is gone.<br>
Like motes and shadows see them move awhile; <br>
Your ears unto your eyes I'll reconcile.<br>
DUMB SHOW.<br>
[Enter PERICLES, at one door, with all his train;]<br>
CLEON and DIONYZA, at the other. CLEON shows<br>
PERICLES the tomb; whereat PERICLES makes<br>
lamentation, puts on sackcloth, and in a mighty<br>
passion departs. Then exeunt CLEON and DIONYZA]<br>
See how belief may suffer by foul show!<br>
This borrow'd passion stands for true old woe;<br>
And Pericles, in sorrow all devour'd, <br>
With sighs shot through, and biggest tears o'ershower'd,<br>
Leaves Tarsus and again embarks. He swears<br>
Never to wash his face, nor cut his hairs:<br>
He puts on sackcloth, and to sea. He bears <br>
A tempest, which his mortal vessel tears,<br>
And yet he rides it out. Now please you wit.<br>
The epitaph is for Marina writ By wicked Dionyza.<br>
[Reads the inscription on MARINA's monument] <br>
'The fairest, sweet'st, and best lies here,<br>
Who wither'd in her spring of year.<br>
She was of Tyrus the king's daughter,<br>
On whom foul death hath made this slaughter;<br>
Marina was she call'd; and at her birth, <br>
Thetis, being proud, swallow'd some part o' the earth:<br>
Therefore the earth, fearing to be o'erflow'd,<br>
Hath Thetis' birth-child on the heavens bestow'd:<br>
Wherefore she does, and swears she'll never stint,<br>
Make raging battery upon shores of flint.' <br>
No visor does become black villany<br>
So well as soft and tender flattery.<br>
Let Pericles believe his daughter's dead,<br>
And bear his courses to be ordered<br>
By Lady Fortune; while our scene must play <br>
His daughter's woe and heavy well-a-day<br>
In her unholy service. Patience, then,<br>
And think you now are all in Mytilene.

          In Antiochus and his daughter you have heard<br>
Of monstrous lust the due and just reward:<br>
In Pericles, his queen and daughter, seen,<br>
Although assail'd with fortune fierce and keen, <br>
Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,<br>
Led on by heaven, and crown'd with joy at last:<br>
In Helicanus may you well descry<br>
A figure of truth, of faith, of loyalty:<br>
In reverend Cerimon there well appears <br>
The worth that learned charity aye wears:<br>
For wicked Cleon and his wife, when fame<br>
Had spread their cursed deed, and honour'd name<br>
Of Pericles, to rage the city turn,<br>
That him and his they in his palace burn; <br>
The gods for murder seemed so content<br>
To punish them; although not done, but meant.<br>
So, on your patience evermore attending,<br>
New joy wait on you! Here our play has ending.
