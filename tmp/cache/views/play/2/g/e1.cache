          His company must do his minions grace,<br>	 
Whilst I at home starve for a merry look.<br> 
Hath homely age the alluring beauty took <br>
From my poor cheek? then, he hath wasted it: <br>
Are my discourses dull? barren my wit? <br>
If voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd, <br>
Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard: <br>
Do their gay vestments his affections bait? <br>
That's not my fault; he's master of my state:<br>  
What ruins are in me that can be found  <br>
By him not ruin'd? then is he the ground <br>
Of my defeatures. My decayed fair  <br>
A sunny look of his would soon repair; <br>
But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale <br>
And feeds from home: poor I am but his stale.<br> 
 <font size='-1' style='text-decoration: line-through;'> [Luc.]  Self-harming jealousy! fie! beat it hence.</font><br>
  Adr.  Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.<br> 
I know his eye doth homage otherwhere, <br>
Or else what lets it but he would be here? <br>
Sister, you know he promis'd me a chain:<br>
Would that alone, alone he would detain,  <br>
So he would keep fair quarter with his bed! <br>
I see, the jewel best enamelled <br>
Will lose his beauty; and though gold bides still<br>
That others touch, yet often touching will <br>
Wear gold; and no man that hath a name, <br>
By falsehood and corruption doth it shame. <br>
Since that my beauty cannot please his eye,<br>
I'll weep what's left away, and weeping die.<br>

Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects, <br>
I am not Adriana, nor thy wife. <br>
The time was once when thou unurg'd wouldst vow<br> 
That never words were music to thine ear, <br>
That never object pleasing in thine eye, <br>
That never touch well welcome to thy hand, <br>
That never meat sweet-savour'd in thy taste, <br>
Unless I spake, or look'd, or touch'd, or carv'd to thee.<br> 
How comes it now, my husband, O! how comes it, <br>
That thou art thus estranged from thyself?  <br>
Thyself I call it, being strange to me,<br> 
That, undividable, incorporate, <br>
Am better than thy dear self's better part.<br> 
Ah! do not tear away thyself from me, <br>
For know, my love, as easy mayst thou fall <br>
A drop of water in the breaking gulf,  <br>
And take unmingled thence that drop again, <br>
Without addition or diminishing,<br>
As take from me thyself and not me too. <br>
How dearly would it touch thee to the quick, <br>
Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious,<br> 
And that this body, consecrate to thee,<br>
By ruffian lust should be contaminate! <br>
Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me,<br> 
And hurl the name of husband in my face,  <br>
And tear the stain'd skin off my harlot-brow,<br>
And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring <br>
And break it with a deep-divorcing vow? <br>
I know thou canst; and therefore, see thou do it.<br> 
I am possess'd with an adulterate blot;<br>
My blood is mingled with the crime of lust: <br>
For if we two be one and thou play false, <br>
I do digest the poison of thy flesh, <br>
Being strumpeted by thy contagion.<br>
Keep then fair league and truce with thy true bed;<br> 
I live unstain'd, thou undishonoured.

Alas! poor women, make us but believe, <br>

Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve; <br>
  We in your motion turn, and you may move us. <br>
Then, gentle brother, get you in again; <br>

'Tis holy sport to be a little vain,  <br>
  When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.

          A heavier task could not have been impos'd<br>
Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable; <br>
Yet, that the world may witness that my end<br> 
Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,  <br>
I'll utter what my sorrow gives me leave. <br>
In Syracusa was I born, and wed	 <br>
Unto a woman, happy but for me,	  <br>
And by me too, had not our hap been bad.<br>
With her I liv'd in joy: our wealth increas'd <br>
By prosperous voyages I often made <br>
To Epidamnum; till my factor's death, <br>
And the great care of goods at random left,<br>
Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:  <br>
From whom my absence was not six months old,   <br>
Before herself,'almost at fainting under <br>
The pleasing punishment that women bear,' <br>
Had made provision for her following me, <br>
And soon and safe arrived where I was. <br>
There had she not been long but she became <br>
A joyful mother of two goodly sons;  <br>
And, which was strange, the one so like the other, <br>
As could not be distinguish'd but by names.  <br>
That very hour, and in the self-same inn, <br>
A meaner woman was delivered <br>
Of such a burden, male twins, both alike.<br> 
Those,'for their parents were exceeding poor,'<br> 
I bought, and brought up to attend my sons. <br>
My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,  <br>
Made daily motions for our home return: <br>
Unwilling I agreed; alas! too soon <br>
We came aboard. <br>
A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd,<br>
Before the always-wind-obeying deep <br>
Gave any tragic instance of our harm: <br>
But longer did we not retain much hope; <br>
For what obscured light the heavens did grant <br>
Did but convey unto our fearful minds <br>
A doubtful warrant of immediate death; <br>
Which, though myself would gladly have embrac'd,<br> 
Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,  <br>
Weeping before for what she saw must come, <br>
And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,  <br>
That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear,<br> 
Forc'd me to seek delays for them and me. <br>
And this it was, for other means was none:  <br>
The sailors sought for safety by our boat,   <br>
And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us:  <br>
My wife, more careful for the latter-born,<br>
Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast, <br>
Such as seafaring men provide for storms;  <br>
To him one of the other twins was bound, <br>
Whilst I had been like heedful of the other. <br>
The children thus dispos'd, my wife and I, <br>
Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd, <br>
Fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast; <br>
And floating straight, obedient to the stream,<br>
Were carried towards Corinth, as we thought. <br>
At length the sun, gazing upon the earth, <br>
Dispers'd those vapours that offended us,  <br>
And, by the benefit of his wished light <br>
The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered <br>
Two ships from far making amain to us;  <br>
Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this: <br>
But ere they came,'O! let me say no more;<br>
Gather the sequel by that went before.<br>
<font size='-1' style='text-decoration: line-through'>Duke.  Nay, forward, old man; do not break off so;<br> 
For we may pity, though not pardon thee.</font> <br>
Aege. O! had the gods done so, I had not now <br>
Worthily term'd them merciless to us! <br>
For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,<br> 
We were encounter'd by a mighty rock; <br>
Which being violently borne upon,<br>
Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;<br> 
So that, in this unjust divorce of us <br>
Fortune had left to both of us alike <br>
What to delight in, what to sorrow for.<br>
Her part, poor soul! seeming as burdened <br>
With lesser weight, but not with lesser woe, <br>
Was carried with more speed before the wind,  <br>
And in our sight they three were taken up<br>
By fishermen-of Corinth, as we thought. <br>
At length, another ship had soiz'd on us; <br>
And, knowing whom it was their hap to save, <br>
Gave healthful welcome to their ship-wrack'd guests; <br>
And would have reft the fishers of their prey, <br>
Had not their bark been very slow of sail; <br>
And therefore homeward did they bend their course. <br>
Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss,<br>
That by misfortune was my life prolong'd, <br>
To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.<br>

And that supposed by the common rout  <br>
Against your yet ungalled estimation,  <br>

And dwell upon your grave when you are dead;<br>
For slander lives upon succession,  <br>
For ever housed where it gets possession.

Are you a god? would you create me new? <br>
  Transform me then, and to your power I'll yield. <br>
But if that I am I, then well I know <br>
  Your weeping sister is no wife of mine,<br>
Nor to her bed no homage do I owe: <br>
  Far more, far more, to you do I decline.<br> 
O! train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note, <br>
  To drown me in thy sister flood of tears: <br>
Sing, siren, for thyself, and I will dote: <br>
  Spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs, <br>
And as a bed I'll take them and there lie; <br>
  And, in that glorious supposition think <br>
He gains by death that hath such means to die: <br>  
Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!<br>

Neither disturb'd with the effect of wine,<br> 
Nor heady-rash, provok'd with raging ire, <br>
Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad. <br>
This woman lock'd me out this day from dinner:<br>
That goldsmith there, were he not pack'd with her, <br>
Could witness it, for he was with me then; <br>
Who parted with me to go fetch a chain, <br>
Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,<br>
Where Balthazar and I did dine together.  <br>
Our dinner done, and he not coming thither, <br>
I went to seek him: in the street I met him, <br>
And in his company that gentleman.<br>
There did this perjur'd goldsmith swear me down<br> 
That I this day of him receiv'd the chain,  <br>
Which, God he knows, I saw not; for the which <br>
He did arrest me with an officer.<br>
I did obey, and sent my peasant home <br>
For certain ducats: he with none return'd.<br> 
Then fairly I bespoke the officer <br>
To go in person with me to my house.<br>
By the way we met <br>
My wife, her sister, and a rabble more <br>
Of vile confederates: along with them <br>
They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-fac'd villain,<br>
A mere anatomy, a mountebank, <br>
A threadbare juggler, and a fortune-teller,<br>
A needy, hollow-ey'd, sharp-looking wretch,  <br>
A living-dead man. This pernicious slave,<br>
Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer, <br>
And, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,<br>
And with no face, as 'twere, out-facing me,  <br>
Cries out, I was possess'd. Then, altogether <br>
They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence,  <br>
And in a dark and dankish vault at home <br>
There left me and my man, both bound together;<br>
Till, gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,<br>
I gain'd my freedom, and immediately  <br>
Ran hither to your Grace; whom I beseech <br>
To give me ample satisfaction <br>
For these deep shames and great indignities.<br>
