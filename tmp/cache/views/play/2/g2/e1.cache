          His company must do his minions grace,<br>	 
Whilst I at home starve for a merry look.<br> 
Hath homely age the alluring beauty took <br>
From my poor cheek? then, he hath wasted it: <br>
Are my discourses dull? barren my wit? <br>
If voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd, <br>
Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard: <br>
Do their gay vestments his affections bait? <br>
That's not my fault; he's master of my state:<br>  
What ruins are in me that can be found  <br>
By him not ruin'd? then is he the ground <br>
Of my defeatures. My decayed fair  <br>
A sunny look of his would soon repair; <br>
But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale <br>
And feeds from home: poor I am but his stale.<br> 
 <font size='-1' style='text-decoration: line-through;'> [Luc.]  Self-harming jealousy! fie! beat it hence.</font><br>
  Adr.  Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.<br> 
I know his eye doth homage otherwhere, <br>
Or else what lets it but he would be here? <br>
Sister, you know he promis'd me a chain:<br>
Would that alone, alone he would detain,  <br>
So he would keep fair quarter with his bed! <br>
I see, the jewel best enamelled <br>
Will lose his beauty; and though gold bides still<br>
That others touch, yet often touching will <br>
Wear gold; and no man that hath a name, <br>
By falsehood and corruption doth it shame. <br>
Since that my beauty cannot please his eye,<br>
I'll weep what's left away, and weeping die.<br>

          Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange, and frown:<br>	 
Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects, <br>
I am not Adriana, nor thy wife. <br>
The time was once when thou unurg'd wouldst vow<br> 
That never words were music to thine ear, <br>
That never object pleasing in thine eye, <br>
That never touch well welcome to thy hand, <br>
That never meat sweet-savour'd in thy taste, <br>
Unless I spake, or look'd, or touch'd, or carv'd to thee.<br> 
How comes it now, my husband, O! how comes it, <br>
That thou art thus estranged from thyself?  <br>
Thyself I call it, being strange to me,<br> 
That, undividable, incorporate, <br>
Am better than thy dear self's better part.<br> 
Ah! do not tear away thyself from me, <br>
For know, my love, as easy mayst thou fall <br>
A drop of water in the breaking gulf,  <br>
And take unmingled thence that drop again, <br>
Without addition or diminishing,<br>
As take from me thyself and not me too. <br>
How dearly would it touch thee to the quick, <br>
Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious,<br> 
And that this body, consecrate to thee,<br>
By ruffian lust should be contaminate! <br>
Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me,<br> 
And hurl the name of husband in my face,  <br>
And tear the stain'd skin off my harlot-brow,<br>
And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring <br>
And break it with a deep-divorcing vow? <br>
I know thou canst; and therefore, see thou do it.<br> 
I am possess'd with an adulterate blot;<br>
My blood is mingled with the crime of lust: <br>
For if we two be one and thou play false, <br>
I do digest the poison of thy flesh, <br>
Being strumpeted by thy contagion.<br>
Keep then fair league and truce with thy true bed;<br> 
I live unstain'd, thou undishonoured.

Look sweet, speak fair, become disloyalty; <br>
  Apparel vice like virtue's harbinger; <br>
Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted;<br> 
  Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint; <br>
Be secret-false: what need she be acquainted? <br>
  What simple thief brags of his own attaint?  <br>
'Tis double wrong to truant with your bed,<br> 
  And let her read it in thy looks at board: <br>
Shame hath a bastard fame, well managed; <br>
  Ill deeds are doubled with an evil word. <br>
Alas! poor women, make us but believe, <br>
  Being compact of credit, that you love us;<br>
Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve; <br>
  We in your motion turn, and you may move us. <br>
Then, gentle brother, get you in again; <br>
  Comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife: <br>
'Tis holy sport to be a little vain,  <br>
  When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.

Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair, <br>

The consequence is then, thy jealous fits <br>
Have scar'd thy husband from the use of wits.

Doing displeasure to the citizens <br>
By rushing in their houses, bearing thence<br> 
Rings, jewels, anything his rage did like. <br>
Once did I get him bound and sent him home,  <br>
Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went <br>

Anon, I wot not by what strong escape,<br>
He broke from those that had the guard of him,<br> 
And with his mad attendant and himself, <br>
Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords <br>
Met us again, and, madly bent on us <br>
Chas.d us away, till, raising of more aid<br> 
We came again to bind them. Then they fled <br>
Into this abbey, whither we pursu.d them; <br>
And here the abbess shuts the gates on us,<br>
And will not suffer us to fetch him out, <br>
Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.<br> 
Therefore, most gracious duke, with thy command <br>
Let him be brought forth, and borne hence for help.<br>
  Duke.  Long since thy husband serv.d me in my wars, <br>
And I to thee engag.d a prince.s word,  <br>
When thou didst make him master of thy bed, <br>
To do him all the grace and good I could.<br>
Go, some of you, knock at the abbey gate <br>
And bid the lady abbess come to me.  <br>
I will determine this before I stir.
