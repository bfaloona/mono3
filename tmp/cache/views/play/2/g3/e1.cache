          Merchant of Syracusa, plead no more. <br>
I am not partial to infringe our laws:	 <br> 
The enmity and discord which of late <br>
Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke<br>
To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen, <br>
Who, wanting guilders to redeem their lives, <br>
Have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods, <br>
Excludes all pity from our threat'ning looks. <br>
For, since the mortal and intestine jars <br>
'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us, <br>
It hath in solemn synods been decreed, <br>
Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,  <br>
T' admit no traffic to our adverse towns: <br>
Nay, more, if any, born at Ephesus  <br>
Be seen at Syracusian marts and fairs; <br>
Again, if any Syracusian born <br>
Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies, <br>
His goods confiscate to the duke's dispose; <br>
Unless a thousand marks be levied,  <br>
To quit the penalty and to ransom him. <br>
Thy substance, valu'd at the highest rate, <br>
Cannot amount unto a hundred marks; <br>
Therefore, by law thou art condemn'd to die.

          A heavier task could not have been impos'd<br>
Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable; <br>
Yet, that the world may witness that my end<br> 
Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,  <br>
I'll utter what my sorrow gives me leave. <br>
In Syracusa was I born, and wed	 <br>
Unto a woman, happy but for me,	  <br>
And by me too, had not our hap been bad.<br>
With her I liv'd in joy: our wealth increas'd <br>
By prosperous voyages I often made <br>
To Epidamnum; till my factor's death, <br>
And the great care of goods at random left,<br>
Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:  <br>
From whom my absence was not six months old,   <br>
Before herself,'almost at fainting under <br>
The pleasing punishment that women bear,' <br>
Had made provision for her following me, <br>
And soon and safe arrived where I was. <br>
There had she not been long but she became <br>
A joyful mother of two goodly sons;  <br>
And, which was strange, the one so like the other, <br>
As could not be distinguish'd but by names.  <br>
That very hour, and in the self-same inn, <br>
A meaner woman was delivered <br>
Of such a burden, male twins, both alike.<br> 
Those,'for their parents were exceeding poor,'<br> 
I bought, and brought up to attend my sons. <br>
My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,  <br>
Made daily motions for our home return: <br>
Unwilling I agreed; alas! too soon <br>
We came aboard. <br>
A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd,<br>
Before the always-wind-obeying deep <br>
Gave any tragic instance of our harm: <br>
But longer did we not retain much hope; <br>
For what obscured light the heavens did grant <br>
Did but convey unto our fearful minds <br>
A doubtful warrant of immediate death; <br>
Which, though myself would gladly have embrac'd,<br> 
Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,  <br>
Weeping before for what she saw must come, <br>
And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,  <br>
That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear,<br> 
Forc'd me to seek delays for them and me. <br>
And this it was, for other means was none:  <br>
The sailors sought for safety by our boat,   <br>
And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us:  <br>
My wife, more careful for the latter-born,<br>
Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast, <br>
Such as seafaring men provide for storms;  <br>
To him one of the other twins was bound, <br>
Whilst I had been like heedful of the other. <br>
The children thus dispos'd, my wife and I, <br>
Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd, <br>
Fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast; <br>
And floating straight, obedient to the stream,<br>
Were carried towards Corinth, as we thought. <br>
At length the sun, gazing upon the earth, <br>
Dispers'd those vapours that offended us,  <br>
And, by the benefit of his wished light <br>
The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered <br>
Two ships from far making amain to us;  <br>
Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this: <br>
But ere they came,'O! let me say no more;<br>
Gather the sequel by that went before.<br>
<font size='-1' style='text-decoration: line-through'>Duke.  Nay, forward, old man; do not break off so;<br> 
For we may pity, though not pardon thee.</font> <br>
Aege. O! had the gods done so, I had not now <br>
Worthily term'd them merciless to us! <br>
For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,<br> 
We were encounter'd by a mighty rock; <br>
Which being violently borne upon,<br>
Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;<br> 
So that, in this unjust divorce of us <br>
Fortune had left to both of us alike <br>
What to delight in, what to sorrow for.<br>
Her part, poor soul! seeming as burdened <br>
With lesser weight, but not with lesser woe, <br>
Was carried with more speed before the wind,  <br>
And in our sight they three were taken up<br>
By fishermen-of Corinth, as we thought. <br>
At length, another ship had soiz'd on us; <br>
And, knowing whom it was their hap to save, <br>
Gave healthful welcome to their ship-wrack'd guests; <br>
And would have reft the fishers of their prey, <br>
Had not their bark been very slow of sail; <br>
And therefore homeward did they bend their course. <br>
Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss,<br>
That by misfortune was my life prolong'd, <br>
To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.<br>

Neither disturb'd with the effect of wine,<br> 
Nor heady-rash, provok'd with raging ire, <br>
Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad. <br>
This woman lock'd me out this day from dinner:<br>
That goldsmith there, were he not pack'd with her, <br>
Could witness it, for he was with me then; <br>
Who parted with me to go fetch a chain, <br>
Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,<br>
Where Balthazar and I did dine together.  <br>
Our dinner done, and he not coming thither, <br>
I went to seek him: in the street I met him, <br>
And in his company that gentleman.<br>
There did this perjur'd goldsmith swear me down<br> 
That I this day of him receiv'd the chain,  <br>
Which, God he knows, I saw not; for the which <br>
He did arrest me with an officer.<br>
I did obey, and sent my peasant home <br>
For certain ducats: he with none return'd.<br> 
Then fairly I bespoke the officer <br>
To go in person with me to my house.<br>
By the way we met <br>
My wife, her sister, and a rabble more <br>
Of vile confederates: along with them <br>
They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-fac'd villain,<br>
A mere anatomy, a mountebank, <br>
A threadbare juggler, and a fortune-teller,<br>
A needy, hollow-ey'd, sharp-looking wretch,  <br>
A living-dead man. This pernicious slave,<br>
Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer, <br>
And, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,<br>
And with no face, as 'twere, out-facing me,  <br>
Cries out, I was possess'd. Then, altogether <br>
They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence,  <br>
And in a dark and dankish vault at home <br>
There left me and my man, both bound together;<br>
Till, gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,<br>
I gain'd my freedom, and immediately  <br>
Ran hither to your Grace; whom I beseech <br>
To give me ample satisfaction <br>
For these deep shames and great indignities.<br>
