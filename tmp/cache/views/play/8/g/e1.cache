          M, O, A, I; this simulation is not as the former: and
      yet, to crush this a little, it would bow to me, for
      every one of these letters are in my name. Soft!
      here follows prose.<br>
      <i>[Reads]</i><br>
      'If this fall into thy hand, revolve. In my stars I
      am above thee; but be not afraid of greatness: some
      are born great, some achieve greatness, and some
      have greatness thrust upon 'em. Thy Fates open
      their hands; let thy blood and spirit embrace them;
      and, to inure thyself to what thou art like to be,
      cast thy humble slough and appear fresh. Be
      opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants; let
      thy tongue tang arguments of state; put thyself into
      the trick of singularity: she thus advises thee
      that sighs for thee. Remember who commended thy
      yellow stockings, and wished to see thee ever
      cross-gartered: I say, remember. Go to, thou art
      made, if thou desirest to be so; if not, let me see
      thee a steward still, the fellow of servants, and
      not worthy to touch Fortune's fingers. Farewell.
      She that would alter services with thee,
      THE FORTUNATE-UNHAPPY.'<br>
      Daylight and champaign discovers not more: this is
      open. I will be proud, I will read politic authors,
      I will baffle Sir Toby, I will wash off gross 
      acquaintance, I will be point-devise the very man.
      I do not now fool myself, to let imagination jade
      me; for every reason excites to this, that my lady
      loves me. She did commend my yellow stockings of
      late, she did praise my leg being cross-gartered;
      and in this she manifests herself to my love, and
      with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits
      of her liking. I thank my stars I am happy. I will
      be strange, stout, in yellow stockings, and
      cross-gartered, even with the swiftness of putting 
      on. Jove and my stars be praised! Here is yet a
      postscript.<br>
      <i>[Reads]</i><br>
      'Thou canst not choose but know who I am. If thou
      entertainest my love, let it appear in thy smiling; 
      thy smiles become thee well; therefore in my
      presence still smile, dear my sweet, I prithee.'
      Jove, I thank thee: I will smile; I will do
      everything that thou wilt have me. <br><br>

          O, ho! do you come near me now? no worse man than
Sir Toby to look to me! This concurs directly with 
the letter: she sends him on purpose, that I may
appear stubborn to him; for she incites me to that
in the letter. 'Cast thy humble slough,' says she;
'be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants;
let thy tongue tang with arguments of state; put
thyself into the trick of singularity;' and
consequently sets down the manner how; as, a sad
face, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in the
habit of some sir of note, and so forth. I have
limed her; but it is Jove's doing, and Jove make me
thankful! And when she went away now, 'Let this
fellow be looked to:' fellow! not Malvolio, nor
after my degree, but fellow. Why, every thing
adheres together, that no dram of a scruple, no
scruple of a scruple, no obstacle, no incredulous 
or unsafe circumstance.What can be said? Nothing
that can be can come between me and the full
prospect of my hopes. Well, Jove, not I, is the
doer of this, and he is to be thanked.

<b>Malvolio.</b> Lady, you have. Pray you, peruse that letter.<br>
      You must not now deny it is your hand:<br>
      Write from it, if you can, in hand or phrase;<br>
      Or say 'tis not your seal, nor your invention:<br>
      You can say none of this: well, grant it then<br>
      And tell me, in the modesty of honour,<br>
      Why you have given me such clear lights of favour,<br>
      Bade me come smiling and cross-garter'd to you,<br>
      To put on yellow stockings and to frown <br>
      Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people;<br>
      And, acting this in an obedient hope,<br>
      Why have you suffer'd me to be imprison'd,<br>
      Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest,<br>
      And made the most notorious geck and gull <br>
      That e'er invention play'd on? tell me why.
