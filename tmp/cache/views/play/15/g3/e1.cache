They lie indrench'd. I tell thee I am mad<br>
In Cressid's love: thou answer'st 'she is fair;'<br>
Pour'st in the open ulcer of my heart<br>
Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice,<br>
Handlest in thy discourse, O, that her hand, <br>
In whose comparison all whites are ink,<br>
Writing their own reproach, to whose soft seizure<br>
The cygnet's down is harsh and spirit of sense<br>
Hard as the palm of ploughman: this thou tell'st me,<br>
As true thou tell'st me, when I say I love her; <br>
But, saying thus, instead of oil and balm,<br>
Thou lay'st in every gash that love hath given me<br>
The knife that made it.

Sith every action that hath gone before,<br>
Whereof we have record, trial did draw<br>
Bias and thwart, not answering the aim,<br>
And that unbodied figure of the thought<br>
That gave't surmised shape. Why then, you princes,<br>
Do you with cheeks abash'd behold our works,<br>
And call them shames? which are indeed nought else<br>
But the protractive trials of great Jove<br>
To find persistive constancy in men:<br>
The fineness of which metal is not found<br>
In fortune's love; for then the bold and coward,<br>
The wise and fool, the artist and unread,<br>
The hard and soft seem all affined and kin: <br>
But, in the wind and tempest of her frown,<br>
Distinction, with a broad and powerful fan,<br>
Puffing at all, winnows the light away;<br>
And what hath mass or matter, by itself<br>
Lies rich in virtue and unmingled.

          Troy, yet upon his basis, had been down,<br>
And the great Hector's sword had lack'd a master,<br>
But for these instances. <br>
The specialty of rule hath been neglected:<br>
And, look, how many Grecian tents do stand<br>
Hollow upon this plain, so many hollow factions.<br>
When that the general is not like the hive<br>
To whom the foragers shall all repair, <br>
What honey is expected? Degree being vizarded,<br>
The unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask.<br>
The heavens themselves, the planets and this centre<br>
Observe degree, priority and place,<br>
Insisture, course, proportion, season, form,<br>
Office and custom, in all line of order;<br>
And therefore is the glorious planet Sol<br>
In noble eminence enthroned and sphered<br>
Amidst the other; whose medicinable eye<br>
Corrects the ill aspects of planets evil, <br>
And posts, like the commandment of a king,<br>
Sans cheque to good and bad: but when the planets<br>
In evil mixture to disorder wander,<br>
What plagues and what portents! what mutiny!<br>
What raging of the sea! shaking of earth! <br>
Commotion in the winds! frights, changes, horrors,<br>
Divert and crack, rend and deracinate<br>
The unity and married calm of states<br>
Quite from their fixure! O, when degree is shaked,<br>
Which is the ladder to all high designs, <br>
Then enterprise is sick! How could communities,<br>
Degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities,<br>
Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,<br>
The primogenitive and due of birth,<br>
Prerogative of age, crowns, sceptres, laurels, <br>
But by degree, stand in authentic place?<br>
Take but degree away, untune that string,<br>
And, hark, what discord follows! each thing meets<br>
In mere oppugnancy: the bounded waters<br>
Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores <br>
And make a sop of all this solid globe:<br>
Strength should be lord of imbecility,<br>
And the rude son should strike his father dead:<br>
Force should be right; or rather, right and wrong,<br>
Between whose endless jar justice resides, <br>
Should lose their names, and so should justice too.<br>
Then every thing includes itself in power,<br>
Power into will, will into appetite;<br>
And appetite, an universal wolf,<br>
So doubly seconded with will and power, <br>
Must make perforce an universal prey,<br>
And last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon,<br>
This chaos, when degree is suffocate,<br>
Follows the choking.<br>
And this neglection of degree it is <br>
That by a pace goes backward, with a purpose<br>
It hath to climb. The general's disdain'd<br>
By him one step below, he by the next,<br>
That next by him beneath; so every step,<br>
Exampled by the first pace that is sick <br>
Of his superior, grows to an envious fever<br>
Of pale and bloodless emulation:<br>
And 'tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot,<br>
Not her own sinews. To end a tale of length,<br>
Troy in our weakness stands, not in her strength.

We have, great Agamemnon, here in Troy<br>
A prince call'd Hector,â€”Priam is his father,â€”<br>
Who in this dull and long-continued truce<br>
Is rusty grown: he bade me take a trumpet,<br>

That loves his mistress more than in confession, <br>
With truant vows to her own lips he loves,<br>
And dare avow her beauty and her worth<br>
In other arms than hers,â€”to him this challenge.<br>
Hector, in view of Trojans and of Greeks,<br>
Shall make it good, or do his best to do it, <br>
He hath a lady, wiser, fairer, truer,<br>
Than ever Greek did compass in his arms,<br>
And will to-morrow with his trumpet call<br>
Midway between your tents and walls of Troy,<br>
To rouse a Grecian that is true in love: <br>
If any come, Hector shall honour him;<br>
If none, he'll say in Troy when he retires,<br>
The Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth<br>

Your breath of full consent bellied his sails;<br>
The seas and winds, old wranglers, took a truce<br>
And did him service: he touch'd the ports desired,<br>
And for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive, <br>
He brought a Grecian queen, whose youth and freshness<br>
Wrinkles Apollo's, and makes stale the morning.<br>
Why keep we her? the Grecians keep our aunt:<br>
Is she worth keeping? why, she is a pearl,<br>
Whose price hath launch'd above a thousand ships, <br>
And turn'd crown'd kings to merchants.<br>
If you'll avouch 'twas wisdom Paris wentâ€”<br>
As you must needs, for you all cried 'Go, go,'â€”<br>
If you'll confess he brought home noble prizeâ€”<br>
As you must needs, for you all clapp'd your hands <br>
And cried 'Inestimable!'â€”why do you now<br>

And do a deed that fortune never did,<br>
Beggar the estimation which you prized<br>
Richer than sea and land? O, theft most base, <br>
That we have stol'n what we do fear to keep!<br>
But, thieves, unworthy of a thing so stol'n,<br>

 As done: perseverance, dear my lord,<br>
 Keeps honour bright: to have done is to hang<br>
 Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail<br>
 In monumental mockery. Take the instant way;<br>
 For honour travels in a strait so narrow,<br>
 Where one but goes abreast: keep then the path;<br>
 For emulation hath a thousand sons<br>
 That one by one pursue: if you give way,<br>
 Or hedge aside from the direct forthright,<br>
 Like to an enter'd tide, they all rush by<br>
 And leave you hindmost;<br>
 Or like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank,<br>
 Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,<br>
 O'er-run and trampled on: then what they do in present,<br>
 Though less than yours in past, must o'ertop yours; <br>
 For time is like a fashionable host<br>
 That slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand,<br>
 And with his arms outstretch'd, as he would fly,<br>
 Grasps in the comer: welcome ever smiles,<br>
 And farewell goes out sighing. O, let not virtue seek<br>
 Remuneration for the thing it was;<br>
 For beauty, wit,<br>
 High birth, vigour of bone, desert in service,<br>
 Love, friendship, charity, are subjects all <br>
 To envious and calumniating time.<br>
 One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,<br>
 That all with one consent praise new-born gawds,<br>
 Though they are made and moulded of things past,<br>
 And give to dust that is a little gilt <br>
 More laud than gilt o'er-dusted.<br>
 The present eye praises the present object.<br>
 Then marvel not, thou great and complete man,<br>
 That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax;<br>
 Since things in motion sooner catch the eye <br>
 Than what not stirs. The cry went once on thee,<br>
 And still it might, and yet it may again,<br>
 If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive<br>
 And case thy reputation in thy tent;<br>
 Whose glorious deeds, but in these fields of late, <br>
 Made emulous missions 'mongst the gods themselves<br>
 And drave great Mars to faction.
