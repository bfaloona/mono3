<del><b>Polonius.</b> With what, i' th' name of God?<br><br></del> 

<b>Ophelia.</b> My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,<br>
      Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd,<br>
      No hat upon his head, his stockings foul'd,<br>
      Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;<br>
      Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,<br>
      And with a look so piteous in purport<br>
      As if he had been loosed out of hell <br>
      To speak of horrors- he comes before me. <br><br>

<del><b>Polonius.</b>Mad for thy love?</del><br><br>

<b>Ophelia.</b> My lord, I do not know,<br>
      But truly I do fear it. <br><br>

<del><b>Polonius.</b> What said he?</del><br><br>

<b>Ophelia.</b> He took me by the wrist and held me hard;<br>
      Then goes he to the length of all his arm,<br>
      And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,<br>
      He falls to such perusal of my face<br>
      As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so.<br>
      At last, a little shaking of mine arm,<br>
      And thrice his head thus waving up and down,<br>
      He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound<br>
      As it did seem to shatter all his bulk<br>
      And end his being. That done, he lets me go,<br>
      And with his head over his shoulder turn'd<br>
      He seem'd to find his way without his eyes,<br>
      For out o' doors he went without their help<br>
      And to the last bended their light on me.
