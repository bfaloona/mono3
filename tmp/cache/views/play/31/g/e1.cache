<del><b>Polonius.</b> With what, i' th' name of God?<br><br></del> 

<b>Ophelia.</b> My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,<br>
      Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd,<br>
      No hat upon his head, his stockings foul'd,<br>
      Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;<br>
      Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,<br>
      And with a look so piteous in purport<br>
      As if he had been loosed out of hell <br>
      To speak of horrors- he comes before me. <br><br>

<del><b>Polonius.</b>Mad for thy love?</del><br><br>

<b>Ophelia.</b> My lord, I do not know,<br>
      But truly I do fear it. <br><br>

<del><b>Polonius.</b> What said he?</del><br><br>

<b>Ophelia.</b> He took me by the wrist and held me hard;<br>
      Then goes he to the length of all his arm,<br>
      And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,<br>
      He falls to such perusal of my face<br>
      As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so.<br>
      At last, a little shaking of mine arm,<br>
      And thrice his head thus waving up and down,<br>
      He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound<br>
      As it did seem to shatter all his bulk<br>
      And end his being. That done, he lets me go,<br>
      And with his head over his shoulder turn'd<br>
      He seem'd to find his way without his eyes,<br>
      For out o' doors he went without their help<br>
      And to the last bended their light on me.

      Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,

      Well ratified by law and heraldry,<br>

      Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;<br>
      Against the which a moiety competent<br>
      Was gaged by our king; which had return'd<br>
      To the inheritance of Fortinbras,<br>
      Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same cov'nant <br>
      And carriage of the article design'd,<br>

      Of unimproved mettle hot and full,<br>
      Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,<br>
      Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,<br>

      A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,<br>
      The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead<br>
      Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;<br>
      As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,<br>
      Disasters in the sun; and the moist star <br>
      Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands<br>
      Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.<br>
      And even the like precurse of fierce events,<br>
      As harbingers preceding still the fates<br>

Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,<br>

Importing the surrender of those lands<br>
Lost by his father, with all bands of law,<br>

Thus much the business is: we have here writ<br>
To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,<br>
Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears<br>
Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress <br>
His further gait herein, in that the levies,<br>
The lists, and full proportions are all made<br>
Out of his subject; and we here dispatch<br>
You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,<br>
For bearers of this greeting to old Norway, <br>
Giving to you no further personal power<br>
To business with the King, more than the scope<br>
Of These dilated articles allow. [<i>Gives a paper.</i>]
Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty. <br>

May give his saying deed; which is no further<br>
Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.<br>

To his unmast'red importunity.<br>

Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes.<br>

For the apparel oft proclaims the man,<br>
And they in France of the best rank and station<br>

      And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,<br>
      Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature<br>
      Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid<br>
      To tell the secrets of my prison house, <br>
      I could a tale unfold whose lightest word<br>
      Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,<br>
      Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,<br>
      Thy knotted and combined locks to part,<br>
      And each particular hair to stand on end <br>
      Like quills upon the fretful porcupine.<br>
      But this eternal blazon must not be<br>
      To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!<br>
      If thou didst ever thy dear father love- <br><br>

    <del><b>Hamlet.</b> O God!</del><br><br>

    <B>Father's Ghost.</b> Revenge his foul and most unnatural murther. <br><br>

    <del><b>Hamlet.</b> Murther?</del><br><br> 

    <b>Father's Ghost.</b> Murther most foul, as in the best it is;<br>
      But this most foul, strange, and unnatural. <br><br>

    <del><b>Hamlet.</b> Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift<br>
      As meditation or the thoughts of love,<br>
      May sweep to my revenge. </del><br><br>

    <b>Father's Ghost.</b> I find thee apt;<br>
      And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed<br>
      That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf, <br>
      Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.<br>
      'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,<br>
      A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark<br>
      Is by a forged process of my death<br>
      Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,<br>
      The serpent that did sting thy father's life<br>
      Now wears his crown. <br><br>

    <del><b>Hamlet.</b> O my prophetic soul!<br>
      My uncle? </del><br><br>

    <b>Father's Ghost.</b> Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,<br>
      With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts-<br>
      O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power<br>
      So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust<br>
      The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.<br>
      O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there,<br>
      From me, whose love was of that dignity<br>
      That it went hand in hand even with the vow<br>
      I made to her in marriage, and to decline<br>
      Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor<br>
      To those of mine! <br>
      But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,<br>
      Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,<br>
      So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,<br>
      Will sate itself in a celestial bed<br>
      And prey on garbage. <br>
      But soft! methinks I scent the morning air.<br>
      Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,<br>
      My custom always of the afternoon,<br>
      Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,<br>
      With juice of cursed hebona in a vial, <br>
      And in the porches of my ears did pour<br>
      The leperous distilment; whose effect<br>
      Holds such an enmity with blood of man<br>
      That swift as quicksilver it courses through<br>
      The natural gates and alleys of the body,<br>
      And with a sudden vigour it doth posset<br>
      And curd, like eager droppings into milk,<br>
      The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;<br>
      And a most instant tetter bark'd about,<br>
      Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust<br>
      All my smooth body.<br>
      Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand<br>
      Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd;<br>
      Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,<br>
      Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd, <br>
      No reckoning made, but sent to my account<br>
      With all my imperfections on my head. <br><br>

    <del><B>Hamlet.</b> O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible! </b></del><br><br>

     <b>Father's Ghost.</b> If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.<br>
      Let not the royal bed of Denmark be <br>
      A couch for luxury and damned incest.<br>
      But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,<br>
      Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive<br>
      Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven,<br>
      And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge <br>
      To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.<br>
      The glowworm shows the matin to be near<br>
      And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.<br>
      Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me. <br><br>

Did nothing.<br>
But, as we often see, against some storm,<br>
A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,<br>
The bold winds speechless, and the orb below<br>
As hush as death- anon the dreadful thunder <br>
Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause,<br>
Aroused vengeance sets him new awork;<br>
And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall<br>
On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,<br>
With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword<br>
Now falls on Priam.<br>
Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods,<br>
In general synod take away her power;<br>

Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,<br>
Must (like a whore) unpack my heart with words <br>
And fall a-cursing like a very drab,<br>
A scullion!<br>
Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! Hum, I have heard<br>
That guilty creatures, sitting at a play,<br>
Have by the very cunning of the scene <br>
Been struck so to the soul that presently<br>
They have proclaim'd their malefactions;<br>
For murther, though it have no tongue, will speak<br>
With most miraculous organ, I'll have these Players<br>
Play something like the murther of my father <br>
Before mine uncle. I'll observe his looks;<br>
I'll tent him to the quick. If he but blench,<br>
I know my course. The spirit that I have seen<br>
May be a devil; and the devil hath power<br>
T' assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps<br>
Out of my weakness and my melancholy,<br>
As he is very potent with such spirits,<br>
Abuses me to damn me. I'll have grounds<br>
More relative than this. The play's the thing<br>
Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King. <br>

          <b>Hamlet.</b> Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounc'd it to you,
      trippingly on the tongue. But if you mouth it, as many of our
      players do, I had as live the town crier spoke my lines. Nor do 
      not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all
      gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I may say)
      whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a
      temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the
      soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to
      tatters, to very rags, to split the cars of the groundlings, who
      (for the most part) are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb
      shows and noise. I would have such a fellow whipp'd for o'erdoing
      Termagant. It out-herods Herod. Pray you avoid it. <br><br>

 <del><b> First Player.</b> I warrant your honour. </del><br><br>

<b> Hamlet.</b> Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be your
      tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with
      this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of
      nature: for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing,
      whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as
      'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show Virtue her own feature,
      scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his
      form and pressure. Now this overdone, or come tardy off, though
      it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious
      grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance 
      o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I
      have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly (not to
      speak it profanely), that, neither having the accent of
      Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so
      strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of Nature's 
      journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated
      humanity so abominably. <br><br>

<del><b> First Player.</b> I hope we have reform'd that indifferently with us, sir. </del><br><br>

<b>Hamlet.</b> O, reform it altogether! And let those that play your clowns
      speak no more than is set down for them. For there be of them 
      that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren
      spectators to laugh too, though in the mean time some necessary
      question of the play be then to be considered. That's villanous
      and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go
      make you ready. <br><br>

It is a damned ghost that we have seen,<br>

hath borne me on his back a thousand times. And now how abhorred
in my imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung those
lips that I have kiss'd I know not how oft. Where be your gibes
now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment that 
were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock your
own grinning? Quite chap- fall'n? Now get you to my lady's
chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this
favour she must come. Make her laugh at that. <br>
