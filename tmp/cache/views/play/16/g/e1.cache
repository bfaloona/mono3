          Nay, 'twill be this hour ere I have done weeping;
all the kind of the Launces have this very fault. I
have received my proportion, like the prodigious 
son, and am going with Sir Proteus to the Imperial's
court. I think Crab, my dog, be the sourest-natured
dog that lives: my mother weeping, my father
wailing, my sister crying, our maid howling, our cat
wringing her hands, and all our house in a great 600
perplexity, yet did not this cruel-hearted cur shed
one tear: he is a stone, a very pebble stone, and
has no more pity in him than a dog: a Jew would have
wept to have seen our parting; why, my grandam,
having no eyes, look you, wept herself blind at my 
parting. Nay, I'll show you the manner of it. This
shoe is my father: no, this left shoe is my father:
no, no, this left shoe is my mother: nay, that
cannot be so neither: yes, it is so, it is so, it
hath the worser sole. This shoe, with the hole in 
it, is my mother, and this my father; a vengeance
on't! there 'tis: now, sit, this staff is my
sister, for, look you, she is as white as a lily and
as small as a wand: this hat is Nan, our maid: I
am the dog: no, the dog is himself, and I am the 
dogâ€”Oh! the dog is me, and I am myself; ay, so,
so. Now come I to my father; Father, your blessing:
now should not the shoe speak a word for weeping:
now should I kiss my father; well, he weeps on. Now
come I to my mother: O, that she could speak now 
like a wood woman! Well, I kiss her; why, there
'tis; here's my mother's breath up and down. Now
come I to my sister; mark the moan she makes. Now
the dog all this while sheds not a tear nor speaks a
word; but see how I lay the dust with my tears.

I have done penance for contemning Love,<br>
Whose high imperious thoughts have punish'd me<br>
With bitter fasts, with penitential groans,<br>

For in revenge of my contempt of love, <br>
Love hath chased sleep from my enthralled eyes<br>
And made them watchers of mine own heart's sorrow.<br>
O gentle Proteus, Love's a mighty lord,<br>
And hath so humbled me, as, I confess,<br>
There is no woe to his correction, <br>
Nor to his service no such joy on earth.<br>
Now no discourse, except it be of love;<br>
Now can I break my fast, dine, sup and sleep,<br>
Upon the very naked name of love.

'Tis but her picture I have yet beheld,<br>

But when I look on her perfections,<br>
There is no reason but I shall be blind.<br>
If I can cheque my erring love, I will;<br>
If not, to compass her I'll use my skill.

O sweet-suggesting Love, if thou hast sinned,<br>

I cannot now prove constant to myself,<br>
Without some treachery used to Valentine.<br>
This night he meaneth with a corded ladder<br>
To climb celestial Silvia's chamber-window,<br>
Myself in counsel, his competitor. <br>
Now presently I'll give her father notice<br>
Of their disguising and pretended flight;<br>
Who, all enraged, will banish Valentine;<br>
For Thurio, he intends, shall wed his daughter;<br>
But, Valentine being gone, I'll quickly cross <br>
By some sly trick blunt Thurio's dull proceeding.<br>
Love, lend me wings to make my purpose swift,<br>
As thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift!

'My thoughts do harbour with my Silvia nightly,<br>

O, could their master come and go as lightly,<br>
Himself would lodge where senseless they are lying!<br>
My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them:<br>

I curse myself, for they are sent by me, <br>
That they should harbour where their lord would be.'<br>
What's here?<br>
'Silvia, this night I will enfranchise thee.'<br>
'Tis so; and here's the ladder for the purpose.<br>
Why, Phaeton,â€”for thou art Merops' son,â€” <br>
Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car<br>
And with thy daring folly burn the world?<br>
Wilt thou reach stars, because they shine on thee?<br>
Go, base intruder! overweening slave!<br>
Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates,<br>
And think my patience, more than thy desert,<br>
Is privilege for thy departure hence:<br>
Thank me for this more than for all the favours<br>
Which all too much I have bestow'd on thee.<br>
But if thou linger in my territories <br>
Longer than swiftest expedition<br>
Will give thee time to leave our royal court,<br>
By heaven! my wrath shall far exceed the love<br>
I ever bore my daughter or thyself.<br>
Be gone! I will not hear thy vain excuse; <br>
But, as thou lovest thy life, make speed from hence.

          When a man's servant shall play the cur with him,
look you, it goes hard: one that I brought up of a 
puppy; one that I saved from drowning, when three or
four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it.
I have taught him, even as one would say precisely,
'thus I would teach a dog.' I was sent to deliver
him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master;
and I came no sooner into the dining-chamber but he
steps me to her trencher and steals her capon's leg:
O, 'tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself
in all companies! I would have, as one should say,
one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be, 
as it were, a dog at all things. If I had not had
more wit than he, to take a fault upon me that he did,
I think verily he had been hanged for't; sure as I
live, he had suffered for't; you shall judge. He
thrusts me himself into the company of three or four
gentlemanlike dogs under the duke's table: he had
not been thereâ€”bless the mark!â€”a pissing while, but
all the chamber smelt him. 'Out with the dog!' says
one: 'What cur is that?' says another: 'Whip him
out' says the third: 'Hang him up' says the duke. 
I, having been acquainted with the smell before,
knew it was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that
whips the dogs: 'Friend,' quoth I, 'you mean to whip
the dog?' 'Ay, marry, do I,' quoth he. 'You do him
the more wrong,' quoth I; 'twas I did the thing you 
wot of.' He makes me no more ado, but whips me out
of the chamber. How many masters would do this for
his servant? Nay, I'll be sworn, I have sat in the
stocks for puddings he hath stolen, otherwise he had
been executed; I have stood on the pillory for geese
he hath killed, otherwise he had suffered for't.
Thou thinkest not of this now. Nay, I remember the
trick you served me when I took my leave of Madam
Silvia: did not I bid thee still mark me and do as I
do? when didst thou see me heave up my leg and make 
water against a gentlewoman's farthingale? didst
thou ever see me do such a trick?

Here is her picture: let me see; I think, <br>
If I had such a tire, this face of mine<br>
Were full as lovely as is this of hers:<br>
And yet the painter flatter'd her a little,<br>
Unless I flatter with myself too much.<br>
Her hair is auburn, mine is perfect yellow:<br>
If that be all the difference in his love,<br>
I'll get me such a colour'd periwig.<br>
Her eyes are grey as glass, and so are mine:<br>
Ay, but her forehead's low, and mine's as high.<br>
What should it be that he respects in her <br>
But I can make respective in myself,<br>
If this fond Love were not a blinded god?<br>
Come, shadow, come and take this shadow up,<br>
For 'tis thy rival. O thou senseless form,<br>
Thou shalt be worshipp'd, kiss'd, loved and adored! <br>
And, were there sense in his idolatry,<br>
My substance should be statue in thy stead.<br>
I'll use thee kindly for thy mistress' sake,<br>
That used me so; or else, by Jove I vow,<br>
I should have scratch'd out your unseeing eyes <br>
To make my master out of love with thee!
