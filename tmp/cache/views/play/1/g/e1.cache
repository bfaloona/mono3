          Ros.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been told so of many: but indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was in his youth an inland man; one that knew courtship too well, for there he fell in love. I have heard him read many lectures against it; and I thank God, I am not a woman, to be touched with so many giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their whole sex withal.<p>  
<font size='-1' style='text-decoration: line-through'>Orl.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of women?</font><p>
  Ros.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were none principal; they were all like one another as half-pence are; every one fault seeming monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it. <p>
<font size='-1' style='text-decoration: line-through'>Orl.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I prithee, recount some of them. <p></font>
  Ros.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I will not cast away my physic, but on those that are sick. There is a man haunts the forest, that abuses our young plants with carving -Rosalind- on their barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns, and elegies on brambles; all, forsooth, deifying the name of Rosalind: if I could meet that fancy-monger, I would give him some good counsel, for he seems to have the quotidian of love upon him. <p> 
  <font size='-1' style='text-decoration: line-through'>Orl.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am he that is so love-shaked. I pray you, tell me your remedy.</font> <p>
  Ros.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is none of my uncle.s marks upon you: he taught me how to know a man in love; in which cage of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.<p> 
  <font size='-1' style='text-decoration: line-through'>Orl.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What were his marks? <p></font>
  Ros.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lean cheek, which you have not; a blue eye and sunken, which you have not; an unquestionable spirit, which you have not; a beard neglected, which you have not: but I pardon you for that, for, simply, your having in beard is a younger brother's revenue. Then, your hose should be ungartered, your bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe untied, and everything about you demonstrating a careless desolation. But you are no such man: you are rather point-device in your accoutrements; as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.  <p>
  <font size='-1' style='text-decoration: line-through'>Orl.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.<p></font>
  Ros.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me believe it! you may as soon make her that you love believe it; which, I warrant, she is apter to do than to confess she does; that is one of the points in the which women still give the lie to their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he that hangs the verses on the trees, wherein Rosalind is so admired? <p>
  <font size='-1' style='text-decoration: line-through'>Orl.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he. <p></font>
  Ros.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But are you so much in love as your rimes speak? <p>
  <font size='-1' style='text-decoration: line-through'>Orl.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither rime nor reason can express how much.<p></font>
  Ros.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do; and the reason why they are not so punished and cured is, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel. <p>
  <font size='-1' style='text-decoration: line-through'>Orl.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you ever cure any so?  <p></font>
  Ros.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, one; and in this manner. He was to imagine me his love, his mistress; and I set him every day to woo me: at which time would I, being but a moonish youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing and liking; proud, fantastical, apish, shallow, inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles, for every passion something, and for no passion truly anything, as boys and women are, for the most part, cattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathe him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor from his mad humour of love to a living humour of madness, which was, to forswear the full stream of the world, and to live in a nook merely monastic. And thus I cured him; and this way will I take upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep.s heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in't. <p>
  <font size='-1' style='text-decoration: line-through'>Orl.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not be cured, youth. <p></font>
  Ros.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind, and come every day to my cote and woo me. <p>
  <font size='-1' style='text-decoration: line-through'>Orl.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, by the faith of my love, I will: tell me where it is. <p></font>
  Ros.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go with me to it and I'll show it you; and by the way you shall tell me where in the forest you live. Will you go? <p>
  <font size='-1' style='text-decoration: line-through'>Orl.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all my heart, good youth. <p>
  Ros.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nay, you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you go?

Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?  <br>
Why, what means this? Why do you look on me? <br>

That can entame my spirits to your worship. <br>
You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,<br> 
Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain? <br>
You are a thousand times a properer man <br>
Than she a woman: 'tis such fools as you  <br>
That make the world full of ill-favour'd children:<br> 
'Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her; <br>
And out of you she sees herself more proper<br>
Than any of her lineaments can show her. <br>
But, mistress, know yourself: down on your knees,<br> 
And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love:  <br>
For I must tell you friendly in your ear, <br>
Sell when you can; you are not for all markets.<br> 
Cry the man mercy; love him; take his offer: <br>
Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer. <br>
So take her to thee, shepherd. Fare you well.<br>

But what care I for words? yet words do well, <br>

It is a pretty youth: not very pretty: <br>
But, sure, he's proud; and yet his pride becomes him:<br> 
He'll make a proper man: the best thing in him <br>
Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue <br>
Did make offence his eye did heal it up.<br>
He is not very tall; yet for his years he's tall:<br> 
His leg is but so so; and yet 'tis well: <br>
There was a pretty redness in his lip, <br>
A little riper and more lusty red <br>
Than that mix'd in his cheek; 'twas just the difference<br> 
Betwixt the constant red and mingled damask.  <br>
There be some women, Silvius, had they mark'd him <br>
In parcels as I did, would have gone near<br>
To fall in love with him; but, for my part, <br>
I love him not nor hate him not; and yet <br>
Have more cause to hate him than to love him: <br>
For what had he to do to chide at me?<br>
He said mine eyes were black and my hair black;<br> 
And, now I am remember'd, scorn'd at me.  <br>
I marvel why I answer'd not again: <br>
But that's all one; omittance is no quittance.<br>

          Ros.  O! I know where you are. Nay, 'tis true: there was never anything so sudden but the fight of two rams, Caesar's thrasonical brag of 'I came, saw, and overcame:' for your brother and my sister no sooner met, but they looked; no sooner looked but they loved; no sooner loved but they sighed; no sooner sighed but they asked one another the reason; no sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy: and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs to marriage which they will climb incontinent, or else be incontinent before marriage. They are in the very wrath of love, and they will together: clubs cannot part them.  <p>
<font size='1'>  Orl.  They shall be married to-morrow, and I will bid the duke to the nuptial. But, O! how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another man's eyes. By so much the more shall I to-morrow be at the height of heart-heaviness, by how much I shall think my brother happy in having what he wishes for.  
<p>  Ros.  Why then, to-morrow I cannot serve your turn for Rosalind? 
<p>  Orl.  I can live no longer by thinking.</font> 
<p>  Ros.  I will weary you then no longer with idle talking. Know of me then,'for now I speak to some purpose,'that I know you are a gentleman of good conceit. I speak not this that you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge, insomuch I say I know you are; neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may in some little measure draw a belief from you, to do yourself good, and not to grace me. Believe then, if you please, that I can do strange things. I have, since I was three years old, conversed with a magician, most profound in his art and yet not damnable. If you do love Rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries it out, when your brother marries Aliena, shall you marry her. I know into what straits of fortune she is driven; and it is not impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient to you, to set her before your eyes to-morrow, human as she is, and without any danger.

          As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns, and, as thou sayest, charged my brother on his blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part, he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses are bred better; for, besides that they are fair with their feeding, they are taught their manage, and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his brother, gain nothing under him but growth, for the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave me, his countenance seems to take from me: he lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that grieves me; and the spirit of my father, which I think is within me, begins to mutiny against this servitude. I will no longer endure it, though yet I know no wise remedy how to avoid it.

          Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had myself notice of my brother's purpose herein, and have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from it, but he is resolute. I'll tell thee, Charles, it is the stubbornest young fellow of France; full of ambition, an envious emulator of every man's good parts, a secret and villanous contriver against me his natural brother: therefore use thy discretion. I had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger. And thou wert best look to't; for if thou dost him any slight disgrace, or if he do not mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise against thee by poison, entrap thee by some treacherous device, and never leave thee till he hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other; for, I assure thee,'and almost with tears I speak it,'there is not one so young and so villanous this day living' I speak but brotherly of him; but should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must blush and weep, and thou must look pale and wonder. 
<p> <font size='-1' style='text-decoration: line-through;'> Cha.  I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come to-morrow, I'll give him his payment: if ever he go alone again, I'll never wrestle for prize more; and so God keep your worship!  [Exit.] </font> <p>
Farewell, good Charles. Now will I stir this gamester. I hope I shall see an end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why, hates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle, never schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of all sorts enchantingly beloved, and, indeed so much in the heart of the world, and especially of my own people, who best know him, that I am altogether misprised. But it shall not be so long; this wrestler shall clear all: nothing remains but that I kindle the boy thither, which now I'll go about.

To burn the lodging where you use to lie, <br>
And you within it: if he fail of that, <br>
He will have other means to cut you off. <br>

Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.

          [Jaq.]  A fool, a fool! I met a fool i' the forest,<br>	 
A motley fool; a miserable world!  <br>
As I do live by food, I met a fool;<br> 
Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun,<br> 
And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms, <br>
In good set terms, and yet a motley fool.  <br>
'Good morrow, fool,' quoth I. 'No, sir,' quoth he, <br>
'Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune.' <br>
And then he drew a dial from his poke, <br>
And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye, <br>
Says very wisely, 'It is ten o'clock; <br>
Thus may we see,' quoth he, 'how the world wags:<br> 
'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine, <br>
And after one hour more 'twill be eleven; <br>
And so, from hour to hour we ripe and ripe, <br>
And then from hour to hour we rot and rot, <br>
And thereby hangs a tale.' When I did hear  <br>
The motley fool thus moral on the time, <br>
My lungs began to crow like chanticleer,  <br>
That fools should be so deep-contemplative, <br>
And I did laugh sans intermission <br>
An hour by his dial. O noble fool! 
A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.<br> 
 <font size='-1' style='text-decoration: line-through;'>
[Duke S.]  What fool is this? <br></font>
[Jaq.]  O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,<br> 
And says, if ladies be but young and fair,<br>
They have the gift to know it; and in his brain,.<br> 
Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit <br>
After a voyage,'he hath strange places crammed'd<br> 
With observation, the which he vents <br>
In mangled forms. O that I were a fool! <br>
I am ambitious for a motley coat.  <br>
<font size='-1' style='text-decoration: line-through;'>
[Duke S.]  Thou shalt have one. </font><br>
[Jaq.]        It is my only suit; <br>
Provided that you weed your better judgments<br> 
Of all opinion that grows rank in them <br>
That I am wise. I must have liberty <br>
Withal, as large a charter as the wind, <br>
To blow on whom I please; for so fools have:<br> 
And they that are most galled with my folly,  <br>
They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so? <br>
The 'why' is plain as way to parish church: <br>
He that a fool doth very wisely hit  <br>
Doth very foolishly, although he smart, <br>
Not to seem senseless of the bob; if not, <br>
The wise man's folly is anatomiz'd  <br>
Even by the squandering glances of the fool.<br> 
Invest me in my motley; give me leave <br>
To speak my mind, and I will through and through<br> 
Cleanse the foul body of th' infected world, <br>
If they will patiently receive my medicine.<br>

His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,<br> 
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.	<br>
And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel,<br> 
And shining morning face, creeping like snail <br>
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover, <br>
Sighing like furnace, with a woful ballad<br>
Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,<br> 
Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard, <br>
Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel, <br>
Seeking the bubble reputation <br>
Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,<br> 
In fair round belly with good capon lin'd, <br>
With eyes severe, and beard of formal cut,  <br>
Full of wise saws and modern instances; 164<br>
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts <br>
Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon, <br>
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side, <br>
His youthful hose well sav'd, a world too wide<br>
For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,  <br>
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes <br>
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all, <br>
That ends this strange eventful history, <br>
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,  <br>
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.<br>

          [Oli.]  When last the young Orlando parted from you<br>	 
He left a promise to return again  <br>
Within an hour; and, pacing through the forest,<br>
Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy, <br>
Lo, what befell! he threw his eye aside, <br>
And mark what object did present itself:  <br>
Under an oak, whose boughs were moss'd with age, <br>
And high top bald with dry antiquity,<br> 
A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,<br> 
Lay sleeping on his back: about his neck <br>
A green and gilded snake had wreath'd itself, <br>
Who with her head nimble in threats approach'd  <br>
The opening of his mouth; but suddenly, <br>
Seeing Orlando, it unlink'd itself, <br>
And with indented glides did slip away  <br>
Into a bush; under which bush's shade <br>
A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,  <br>
Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch,<br> 
When that the sleeping man should stir; for 'tis <br>
The royal disposition of that beast <br>
To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead: <br>
This seen, Orlando did approach the man, <br>
And found it was his brother, his elder brother. <br>
<font size='-1' style='text-decoration: line-through;'> 
[Cel.]  O! I have heard him speak of that same brother;<br>
And he did render him the most unnatural <br>
That liv'd 'mongst men. <br> 
</font>
  [Oli.]        And well he might so do,<br>
For well I know he was unnatural. <br>
<font size='-1' style='text-decoration: line-through;'>
  [Ros.]  But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,<br> 
Food to the suck'd and hungry lioness? <br>
</font>
  [Oli.]  Twice did he turn his back and purpos'd so;<br>
But kindness, nobler ever than revenge, <br>
And nature, stronger than his just occasion,<br> 
Made him give battle to the lioness, <br>
Who quickly fell before him: in which hurtling<br>
From miserable slumber I awak'd. <br>
<font size='-1' style='text-decoration: line-through;'>
  [Cel.]  Are you his brother? <br>
  [Ros.]        Was it you he rescu'd?<br> 
  [Cel.]  Was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?<br>
</font>
  [Oli.]  'Twas I; but 'tis not I. I do not shame <br>
To tell you what I was, since my conversion <br>
So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am. <br>
<font size='-1' style='text-decoration: line-through;'>
  [Ros.]  But, for the bloody napkin?<br>
</font>
  [Oli.]        By and by. <br>
When from the first to last, betwixt us two, <br>
Tears our recountments had most kindly bath'd, <br>
As how I came into that desert place:. <br>
In brief, he led me to the gentle duke,	 <br>
Who gave me fresh array and entertainment, <br>
Committing me unto my brother's love;<br> 
Who led me instantly unto his cave,<br>
There stripp'd himself; and here, upon his arm<br> 
The lioness had torn some flesh away, <br>
Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted,<br> 
And cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind. <br>
Brief, I recover'd him, bound up his wound; <br>
And, after some small space, being strong at heart,<br> 
He sent me hither, stranger as I am, <br>
To tell this story, that you might excuse<br>
His broken promise; and to give this napkin, <br>
Dy'd in his blood, unto the shepherd youth <br>
That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.<br>

A poor virgin, sir, an ill-favoured thing, sir, but mine own: a poor humour of mine, sir, to take that no man else will.

  [Jaq.]  But, for the seventh cause; how did you find the quarrel on the seventh cause?</font><br>
  [Touch.]  Upon a lie seven times removed:'bear your body more seeming, Audrey:'as thus, sir. I did dislike the cut of a certain courtier's beard: he sent me word, if I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the mind it was: this is called 'the retort courteous.' If I sent him word again, it was not well cut, he would send me word, he cut it to please himself: this is called the 'quip modest.' If again, it was not well cut, he disabled my judgment: this is called the 'reply churlish.' If again, it was not well cut, he would answer, I spake not true: this is called the 'reproof valiant:' if again, it was not well cut, he would say, I lie: this is called the 'countercheck quarrelsome': and so to the 'lie circumstantial,' and the 'lie direct.' <br>
<font size='-1' style='text-decoration: line-through;'>
  [Jaq.]  And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut? <br>
</font> 
 [Touch.]  I durst go no further than the 'lie circumstantial,' nor he durst not give me the 'lie direct;' and so we measured swords and parted. <br>
<font size='-1' style='text-decoration: line-through;'> 
 [Jaq.]  Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?<br>
</font>
  [Touch.]  O sir, we quarrel in print; by the book, as you have books for good manners: I will name you the degrees. The first, the 'retort courteous;' the second, the 'quip modest;' the third, the 'reply churlish;' the fourth, the 'reproof valiant;' the fifth, the 'countercheck quarrelsome;' the sixth, the 'lie with circumstance;' the seventh, the 'lie direct.' All these you may avoid but the lie direct; and you may avoid that too, with an 'if.' I knew when seven justices could not take up a quarrel; but when the parties were met themselves, one of them thought but of an 'if,' as 'If you said so, then I said so;' and they shook hands and swore brothers. Your 'if' is the only peace-maker; much virtue in 'if.'
