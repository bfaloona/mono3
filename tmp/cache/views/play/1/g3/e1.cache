          As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns, and, as thou sayest, charged my brother on his blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part, he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses are bred better; for, besides that they are fair with their feeding, they are taught their manage, and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his brother, gain nothing under him but growth, for the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave me, his countenance seems to take from me: he lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that grieves me; and the spirit of my father, which I think is within me, begins to mutiny against this servitude. I will no longer endure it, though yet I know no wise remedy how to avoid it.

          Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had myself notice of my brother's purpose herein, and have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from it, but he is resolute. I'll tell thee, Charles, it is the stubbornest young fellow of France; full of ambition, an envious emulator of every man's good parts, a secret and villanous contriver against me his natural brother: therefore use thy discretion. I had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger. And thou wert best look to't; for if thou dost him any slight disgrace, or if he do not mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise against thee by poison, entrap thee by some treacherous device, and never leave thee till he hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other; for, I assure thee,'and almost with tears I speak it,'there is not one so young and so villanous this day living' I speak but brotherly of him; but should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must blush and weep, and thou must look pale and wonder. 
<p> <font size='-1' style='text-decoration: line-through;'> Cha.  I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come to-morrow, I'll give him his payment: if ever he go alone again, I'll never wrestle for prize more; and so God keep your worship!  [Exit.] </font> <p>
Farewell, good Charles. Now will I stir this gamester. I hope I shall see an end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why, hates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle, never schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of all sorts enchantingly beloved, and, indeed so much in the heart of the world, and especially of my own people, who best know him, that I am altogether misprised. But it shall not be so long; this wrestler shall clear all: nothing remains but that I kindle the boy thither, which now I'll go about.

Hath heard your praises, and this night he means<br> 
To burn the lodging where you use to lie, <br>
And you within it: if he fail of that, <br>
He will have other means to cut you off. <br>
I overheard him and his practices. <br>
This is no place; this house is but a butchery:<br> 
Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.

          [Jaq.]  A fool, a fool! I met a fool i' the forest,<br>	 
A motley fool; a miserable world!  <br>
As I do live by food, I met a fool;<br> 
Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun,<br> 
And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms, <br>
In good set terms, and yet a motley fool.  <br>
'Good morrow, fool,' quoth I. 'No, sir,' quoth he, <br>
'Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune.' <br>
And then he drew a dial from his poke, <br>
And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye, <br>
Says very wisely, 'It is ten o'clock; <br>
Thus may we see,' quoth he, 'how the world wags:<br> 
'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine, <br>
And after one hour more 'twill be eleven; <br>
And so, from hour to hour we ripe and ripe, <br>
And then from hour to hour we rot and rot, <br>
And thereby hangs a tale.' When I did hear  <br>
The motley fool thus moral on the time, <br>
My lungs began to crow like chanticleer,  <br>
That fools should be so deep-contemplative, <br>
And I did laugh sans intermission <br>
An hour by his dial. O noble fool! 
A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.<br> 
 <font size='-1' style='text-decoration: line-through;'>
[Duke S.]  What fool is this? <br></font>
[Jaq.]  O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,<br> 
And says, if ladies be but young and fair,<br>
They have the gift to know it; and in his brain,.<br> 
Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit <br>
After a voyage,'he hath strange places crammed'd<br> 
With observation, the which he vents <br>
In mangled forms. O that I were a fool! <br>
I am ambitious for a motley coat.  <br>
<font size='-1' style='text-decoration: line-through;'>
[Duke S.]  Thou shalt have one. </font><br>
[Jaq.]        It is my only suit; <br>
Provided that you weed your better judgments<br> 
Of all opinion that grows rank in them <br>
That I am wise. I must have liberty <br>
Withal, as large a charter as the wind, <br>
To blow on whom I please; for so fools have:<br> 
And they that are most galled with my folly,  <br>
They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so? <br>
The 'why' is plain as way to parish church: <br>
He that a fool doth very wisely hit  <br>
Doth very foolishly, although he smart, <br>
Not to seem senseless of the bob; if not, <br>
The wise man's folly is anatomiz'd  <br>
Even by the squandering glances of the fool.<br> 
Invest me in my motley; give me leave <br>
To speak my mind, and I will through and through<br> 
Cleanse the foul body of th' infected world, <br>
If they will patiently receive my medicine.<br>

And all the men and women merely players:<Br>
They have their exits and their entrances; <br>
And one man in his time plays many parts, <br>
His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,<br> 
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.	<br>
And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel,<br> 
And shining morning face, creeping like snail <br>
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover, <br>
Sighing like furnace, with a woful ballad<br>
Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,<br> 
Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard, <br>
Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel, <br>
Seeking the bubble reputation <br>
Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,<br> 
In fair round belly with good capon lin'd, <br>
With eyes severe, and beard of formal cut,  <br>
Full of wise saws and modern instances; 164<br>
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts <br>
Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon, <br>
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side, <br>
His youthful hose well sav'd, a world too wide<br>
For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,  <br>
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes <br>
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all, <br>
That ends this strange eventful history, <br>
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,  <br>
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.<br>

          [Oli.]  When last the young Orlando parted from you<br>	 
He left a promise to return again  <br>
Within an hour; and, pacing through the forest,<br>
Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy, <br>
Lo, what befell! he threw his eye aside, <br>
And mark what object did present itself:  <br>
Under an oak, whose boughs were moss'd with age, <br>
And high top bald with dry antiquity,<br> 
A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,<br> 
Lay sleeping on his back: about his neck <br>
A green and gilded snake had wreath'd itself, <br>
Who with her head nimble in threats approach'd  <br>
The opening of his mouth; but suddenly, <br>
Seeing Orlando, it unlink'd itself, <br>
And with indented glides did slip away  <br>
Into a bush; under which bush's shade <br>
A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,  <br>
Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch,<br> 
When that the sleeping man should stir; for 'tis <br>
The royal disposition of that beast <br>
To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead: <br>
This seen, Orlando did approach the man, <br>
And found it was his brother, his elder brother. <br>
<font size='-1' style='text-decoration: line-through;'> 
[Cel.]  O! I have heard him speak of that same brother;<br>
And he did render him the most unnatural <br>
That liv'd 'mongst men. <br> 
</font>
  [Oli.]        And well he might so do,<br>
For well I know he was unnatural. <br>
<font size='-1' style='text-decoration: line-through;'>
  [Ros.]  But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,<br> 
Food to the suck'd and hungry lioness? <br>
</font>
  [Oli.]  Twice did he turn his back and purpos'd so;<br>
But kindness, nobler ever than revenge, <br>
And nature, stronger than his just occasion,<br> 
Made him give battle to the lioness, <br>
Who quickly fell before him: in which hurtling<br>
From miserable slumber I awak'd. <br>
<font size='-1' style='text-decoration: line-through;'>
  [Cel.]  Are you his brother? <br>
  [Ros.]        Was it you he rescu'd?<br> 
  [Cel.]  Was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?<br>
</font>
  [Oli.]  'Twas I; but 'tis not I. I do not shame <br>
To tell you what I was, since my conversion <br>
So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am. <br>
<font size='-1' style='text-decoration: line-through;'>
  [Ros.]  But, for the bloody napkin?<br>
</font>
  [Oli.]        By and by. <br>
When from the first to last, betwixt us two, <br>
Tears our recountments had most kindly bath'd, <br>
As how I came into that desert place:. <br>
In brief, he led me to the gentle duke,	 <br>
Who gave me fresh array and entertainment, <br>
Committing me unto my brother's love;<br> 
Who led me instantly unto his cave,<br>
There stripp'd himself; and here, upon his arm<br> 
The lioness had torn some flesh away, <br>
Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted,<br> 
And cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind. <br>
Brief, I recover'd him, bound up his wound; <br>
And, after some small space, being strong at heart,<br> 
He sent me hither, stranger as I am, <br>
To tell this story, that you might excuse<br>
His broken promise; and to give this napkin, <br>
Dy'd in his blood, unto the shepherd youth <br>
That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.<br>

If I sent him word again, it was not well cut, he would send me word, he cut it to please himself: this is called the 'quip modest.' If again, it was not well cut, he disabled my judgment: this is called the 'reply churlish.' If again, it was not well cut, he would answer, I spake not true: this is called the 'reproof valiant:' if again, it was not well cut, he would say, I lie: this is called the 'countercheck quarrelsome': and so to the 'lie circumstantial,' and the 'lie direct.' <br>

 [Touch.]  I durst go no further than the 'lie circumstantial,' nor he durst not give me the 'lie direct;' and so we measured swords and parted. <br>
<font size='-1' style='text-decoration: line-through;'> 
 [Jaq.]  Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?<br>
</font>
  [Touch.]  O sir, we quarrel in print; by the book, as you have books for good manners: I will name you the degrees. The first, the 'retort courteous;' the second, the 'quip modest;' the third, the 'reply churlish;' the fourth, the 'reproof valiant;' the fifth, the 'countercheck quarrelsome;' the sixth, the 'lie with circumstance;' the seventh, the 'lie direct.' All these you may avoid but the lie direct; and you may avoid that too, with an 'if.' I knew when seven justices could not take up a quarrel; but when the parties were met themselves, one of them thought but of an 'if,' as 'If you said so, then I said so;' and they shook hands and swore brothers. Your 'if' is the only peace-maker; much virtue in 'if.'
