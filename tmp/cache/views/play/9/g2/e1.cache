          O! were that all. I think not on my father;<br>
And these great tears grace his remembrance more<br>  
Than those I shed for him. What was he like? <br>
I have forgot him: my imagination  <br>
Carries no favour in 't but Bertram's. <br>
I am undone: there is no living, none,  <br>
If Bertram be away. It were all one <br>
That I should love a bright particular star<br>
And think to wed it, he is so above me: <br>
In his bright radiance and collateral light <br>
Must I be comforted, not in his sphere. <br>
The ambition in my love thus plagues itself: <br>
The hind that would be mated by the lion <br>
Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though a plague,<br> 
To see him every hour; to sit and draw <br>
His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,<br>
In our heart's table; heart too capable <br>
Of every line and trick of his sweet favour:<br> 
But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy <br>
Must sanctify his reliques. Who comes here? <br>
One that goes with him: I love him for his sake;<br> 
And yet I know him a notorious liar, <br>
Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;<br> 
Yet these fix'd evils sit so fit in him, <br>
That they take place, when virtue's steely bones<br> 
Look bleak in the cold wind: withal, full oft we see <br>
Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.<br>

Here on my knee, before high heaven and you  <br>
That before you, and next unto high heaven,   <br>
I love your son.   <br>
My friends were poor, but honest; so's my love:  <br>
Be not offended, for it hurts not him  <br>
That he is lov'd of me: I follow him not  <br>
By any token of presumptuous suit;  <br>
Nor would I have him till I do deserve him; <br> 
Yet never know how that desert should be.  <br>
I know I love in vain, strive against hope;  <br>
Yet, in this captious and intenible sieve  <br>
I still pour in the waters of my love,  <br>
And lack not to lose still. Thus, Indian-like, <br>
Religious in mine error, I adore  <br>
The sun, that looks upon his worshipper, <br> 
But knows of him no more. My dearest madam, <br>
Let not your hate encounter with my love <br>
For loving where you do: but, if yourself, <br> 
Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth, <br> 
Did ever in so true a flame of liking <br> 
Wish chastely and love dearly, that your Dian  <br>
Was both herself and Love; O! then, give pity   <br>
To her, whose state is such that cannot choose   <br>
But lend and give where she is sure to lose;  <br>
That seeks not to find that her search implies, <br>
But, riddle-like, lives sweetly where she dies.

Nothing in France until he has no wife!	 <br>
Thou shalt have none, Rousillon, none in France;<br>

That chase thee from thy country, and expose <br>
Those tender limbs of thine to the event <br>
Of the non-sparing war? and is it I <br>
That drive thee from the sportive court, where thou<br>

Fly with false aim; move the still-piecing air,<br> 
That sings with piercing; do not touch my lord!	 <br>
Whoever shoots at him, I set him there; <br>
Whoever charges on his forward breast, <br>
I am the caitiff that do hold him to 't; <br>
And, though I kill him not, I am the cause <br>
His death was so effected: better 'twere<br>
I met the ravin lion when he roar'd <br>
With sharp constraint of hunger; better 'twere<br> 
That all the miseries which nature owes	 <br>
Were mine at once. No, come thou home, Rousillon,<br>
Whence honour but of danger wins a scar, <br>
As oft it loses all: I will be gone; <br>
My being here it is that holds thee hence: <br>
Shall I stay here to do 't? no, no, although<br>
The air of paradise did fan the house, <br>
And angels offic'd all: I will be gone, <br>
That pitiful rumour may report my flight, <br>
To consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day!<br>
For with the dark, poor thief, I'll steal away.

As it hath fated her to be my motive <br>
And helper to a husband. But, O strange men!<br> 
That can such sweet use make of what they hate,<br> 
When saucy trusting of the cozen'd thoughts <br>
Defiles the pitchy night: so lust doth play  <br>
With what it loathes for that which is away.   <br>
But more of this hereafter. You, Diana, <br>
Under my poor instructions yet must suffer <br>
Something in my behalf. <p>

  Hel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, I pray you: <br>
But with the word the time will bring on summer,<br>
When briers shall have leaves as well as thorns,  <br>
And be as sweet as sharp. We must away; <br>
Our waggon is prepar'd, and time revives us:<br>
All's well that ends well: still the fine's the crown;<br> 
Whate'er the course, the end is the renown.
