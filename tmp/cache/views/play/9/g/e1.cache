          O! were that all. I think not on my father;<br>
And these great tears grace his remembrance more<br>  
Than those I shed for him. What was he like? <br>
I have forgot him: my imagination  <br>
Carries no favour in 't but Bertram's. <br>
I am undone: there is no living, none,  <br>
If Bertram be away. It were all one <br>
That I should love a bright particular star<br>
And think to wed it, he is so above me: <br>
In his bright radiance and collateral light <br>
Must I be comforted, not in his sphere. <br>
The ambition in my love thus plagues itself: <br>
The hind that would be mated by the lion <br>
Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though a plague,<br> 
To see him every hour; to sit and draw <br>
His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,<br>
In our heart's table; heart too capable <br>
Of every line and trick of his sweet favour:<br> 
But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy <br>
Must sanctify his reliques. Who comes here? <br>
One that goes with him: I love him for his sake;<br> 
And yet I know him a notorious liar, <br>
Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;<br> 
Yet these fix'd evils sit so fit in him, <br>
That they take place, when virtue's steely bones<br> 
Look bleak in the cold wind: withal, full oft we see <br>
Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.<br>

That before you, and next unto high heaven,   <br>
I love your son.   <br>
My friends were poor, but honest; so's my love:  <br>
Be not offended, for it hurts not him  <br>
That he is lov'd of me: I follow him not  <br>
By any token of presumptuous suit;  <br>
Nor would I have him till I do deserve him; <br> 
Yet never know how that desert should be.  <br>
I know I love in vain, strive against hope;  <br>
Yet, in this captious and intenible sieve  <br>
I still pour in the waters of my love,  <br>
And lack not to lose still. Thus, Indian-like, <br>
Religious in mine error, I adore  <br>
The sun, that looks upon his worshipper, <br> 
But knows of him no more. My dearest madam, <br>
Let not your hate encounter with my love <br>
For loving where you do: but, if yourself, <br> 
Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth, <br> 
Did ever in so true a flame of liking <br> 
Wish chastely and love dearly, that your Dian  <br>
Was both herself and Love; O! then, give pity   <br>
To her, whose state is such that cannot choose   <br>
But lend and give where she is sure to lose;  <br>
That seeks not to find that her search implies, <br>
But, riddle-like, lives sweetly where she dies.

Nothing in France until he has no wife!	 <br>
Thou shalt have none, Rousillon, none in France;<br>

Those tender limbs of thine to the event <br>
Of the non-sparing war? and is it I <br>
That drive thee from the sportive court, where thou<br>

Whoever shoots at him, I set him there; <br>
Whoever charges on his forward breast, <br>
I am the caitiff that do hold him to 't; <br>
And, though I kill him not, I am the cause <br>

I met the ravin lion when he roar'd <br>
With sharp constraint of hunger; better 'twere<br> 
That all the miseries which nature owes	 <br>
Were mine at once. No, come thou home, Rousillon,<br>
Whence honour but of danger wins a scar, <br>
As oft it loses all: I will be gone; <br>
My being here it is that holds thee hence: <br>
Shall I stay here to do 't? no, no, although<br>
The air of paradise did fan the house, <br>
And angels offic'd all: I will be gone, <br>
That pitiful rumour may report my flight, <br>
To consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day!<br>
For with the dark, poor thief, I'll steal away.

  Hel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor you, mistress, 
Ever a friend whose thoughts more truly labour<br> 
To recompense your love. Doubt not but heaven <br>

As it hath fated her to be my motive <br>
And helper to a husband. But, O strange men!<br> 
That can such sweet use make of what they hate,<br> 
When saucy trusting of the cozen'd thoughts <br>
Defiles the pitchy night: so lust doth play  <br>
With what it loathes for that which is away.   <br>

Something in my behalf. <p>

          PAROLLES<Br>
Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be blown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational increase and there was never virgin got till virginity was first lost. That you were made of is metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is ever lost: 'tis too cold a companion; away with 't!<p>
<del><font size='-1'>HELENA<Br>
I will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a virgin.</font></del><p>
PAROLLES<Br>
There's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity, is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin: virginity murders itself and should be buried in highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites, much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach. Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but loose by't: out with 't! within ten year it will make itself ten, which is a goodly increase; and the principal itself not much the worse: away with 't!

And wore us out of act. It much repairs me<br>
To talk of your good father. In his youth<br>
He had the wit which I can well observe<br>
To-day in our young lords; but they may jest<br>
Till their own scorn return to them unnoted<br>
Ere they can hide their levity in honour;<br>
So like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness<br>
Were in his pride or sharpness; if they were,<br>
His equal had awaked them, and his honour,<br>
Clock to itself, knew the true minute when<br>
Exception bid him speak, and at this time<br>
His tongue obey'd his hand: who were below him<br>
He used as creatures of another place<br>
And bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks,<br>
Making them proud of his humility,<br>
In their poor praise he humbled.<br>
Such a man Might be a copy to these younger times;<br>
Which, follow'd well, would demonstrate them now<br>
But goers backward.

          'Tis only title thou disdain'st in her, the which<br>
I can build up. Strange is it that our bloods,<br>
Of colour, weight, and heat, pour'd all together,<br>
Would quite confound distinction, yet stand off<br>
In differences so mighty. If she be<br>
All that is virtuous, save what thou dislikest,<br>
A poor physician's daughter, thou dislikest<br>
Of virtue for the name: but do not so:<br>
From lowest place when virtuous things proceed,<br>
The place is dignified by the doer's deed:<br>
Where great additions swell's, and virtue none,<br>
It is a dropsied honour. Good alone<br>
Is good without a name. Vileness is so:<br>
The property by what it is should go,<br>
Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair;<br>
In these to nature she's immediate heir,<br>
And these breed honour: that is honour's scorn,<br>
Which challenges itself as honour's born<br>
And is not like the sire: honours thrive,<br>
When rather from our acts we them derive<br>
Than our foregoers: the mere word's a slave<br>
Debosh'd on every tomb, on every grave<br>
A lying trophy, and as oft is dumb<br>
Where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb<br>
Of honour'd bones indeed. What should be said?<br>
If thou canst like this creature as a maid,<br>
I can create the rest: virtue and she<br>
Is her own dower; honour and wealth from me.<p>
<font size='-1'>BERTRAM
I cannot love her, nor will strive to do't.</font><p>
KING<br>
Thou wrong'st thyself, if thou shouldst strive to choose.<p>
<font size='-1'>HELENA<br>
That you are well restored, my lord, I'm glad:<br>
Let the rest go.</font><p>
KING<br>
My honour's at the stake; which to defeat,<br>
I must produce my power. Here, take her hand,<br>
Proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift;<br>
That dost in vile misprision shackle up<br>
My love and her desert; that canst not dream,<br>
We, poising us in her defective scale,<br>
Shall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know,<br>
It is in us to plant thine honour where<br>
We please to have it grow. Cheque thy contempt:<br>
Obey our will, which travails in thy good:<br>
Believe not thy disdain, but presently<br>
Do thine own fortunes that obedient right<br>
Which both thy duty owes and our power claims;<br>
Or I will throw thee from my care for ever<br>
Into the staggers and the careless lapse<br>
Of youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate<br>
Loosing upon thee, in the name of justice,<br>
Without all terms of pity. Speak; thine answer.<br>
