           I scorn thy meat; 'twould choke me, for I should
ne'er flatter thee. O you gods, what a number of
men eat Timon, and he sees 'em not! It grieves me 
to see so many dip their meat in one man's blood;
and all the madness is, he cheers them up too.
I wonder men dare trust themselves with men:
Methinks they should invite them without knives;
Good for their meat, and safer for their lives. 
There's much example for't; the fellow that sits
next him now, parts bread with him, pledges the
breath of him in a divided draught, is the readiest
man to kill him: 't has been proved. If I were a
huge man, I should fear to drink at meals; 
Lest they should spy my windpipe's dangerous notes:
Great men should drink with harness on their throats.

      Is every flatterer's spirit. Who can call him
      His friend that dips in the same dish? for, in
      My knowing, Timon has been this lord's father,
      And kept his credit with his purse,
      Supported his estate; nay, Timon's money 
      Has paid his men their wages: he ne'er drinks,

      And yetâ€”O, see the monstrousness of man
      When he looks out in an ungrateful shape!â€”
      He does deny him, in respect of his,

<b>First Stranger.</b> For mine own part,
      I never tasted Timon in my life,

      To mark me for his friend; yet, I protest,
      For his right noble mind, illustrious virtue
      And honourable carriage,
      Had his necessity made use of me,
      I would have put my wealth into donation, 
      And the best half should have return'd to him,
      So much I love his heart: but, I perceive,
      Men must learn now with pity to dispense;

Whose procreation, residence, and birth,<br>
Scarce is dividant, touch them with several fortunes;<br>
The greater scorns the lesser: not nature,<br>
To whom all sores lay siege, can bear great fortune, <br>

Raise me this beggar, and deny 't that lord;<br>

So are they all; for every grise of fortune<br>
Is smooth'd by that below: the learned pate<br>
Ducks to the golden fool: all is oblique;<br>
There's nothing level in our cursed natures,<br>
But direct villany. Therefore, be abhorr'd<br>
All feasts, societies, and throngs of men!<br>
His semblable, yea, himself, Timon disdains:<br>
Destruction fang mankind! Earth, yield me roots!<br>
[Digging]<br>
Who seeks for better of thee, sauce his palate<br>
With thy most operant poison! What is here?<br>
Gold? yellow, glittering, precious gold? No, gods, <br>
I am no idle votarist: roots, you clear heavens!<br>
Thus much of this will make black white, foul fair,<br>
Wrong right, base noble, old young, coward valiant.<br>
Ha, you gods! why this? what this, you gods? Why, this<br>
Will lug your priests and servants from your sides, <br>
Pluck stout men's pillows from below their heads:<br>
This yellow slave<br>
Will knit and break religions, bless the accursed,<br>
Make the hoar leprosy adored, place thieves<br>
And give them title, knee and approbation <br>
With senators on the bench: this is it<br>
That makes the wappen'd widow wed again;<br>
She, whom the spital-house and ulcerous sores<br>
Would cast the gorge at, this embalms and spices<br>
To the April day again. Come, damned earth,<br>
Thou common whore of mankind, that put'st odds<br>
Among the route of nations, I will make thee<br>
Do thy right nature.

          Well, sir, I will; therefore, I will, sir; thus:<br>
If Alcibiades kill my countrymen,<br>
Let Alcibiades know this of Timon,<br>
That Timon cares not. But if be sack fair Athens,<br>
And take our goodly aged men by the beards,<br>
Giving our holy virgins to the stain<br>
Of contumelious, beastly, mad-brain'd war,<br>
Then let him know, and tell him Timon speaks it,<br>
In pity of our aged and our youth, <br>
I cannot choose but tell him, that I care not,<br>
And let him take't at worst; for their knives care not,<br>
While you have throats to answer: for myself,<br>
There's not a whittle in the unruly camp<br>
But I do prize it at my love before<br>
The reverend'st throat in Athens. So I leave you<br>
To the protection of the prosperous gods,<br>
As thieves to keepers.

          [Reads the epitaph] 'Here lies a <br>
wretched corse, of wretched soul bereft:<br>
Seek not my name: a plague consume you wicked caitiffs left!<br>
Here lie I, Timon; who, alive, all living men did hate:<br>
Pass by and curse thy fill, but pass and stay not here thy gait.'<br>
These well express in thee thy latter spirits:<br>
Though thou abhorr'dst in us our human griefs,<br>
Scorn'dst our brain's flow and those our droplets which <br>
From niggard nature fall, yet rich conceit<br>
Taught thee to make vast Neptune weep for aye<br>
On thy low grave, on faults forgiven. <br>
Dead Is noble Timon: of whose memory<br>
Hereafter more. Bring me into your city, <br>
And I will use the olive with my sword,<br>
Make war breed peace, make peace stint war, make each<br>
Prescribe to other as each other's leech.<br>
Let our drums strike.
