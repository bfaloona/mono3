          The crickets sing, and man's o'erlabour'd sense	<br>
Repairs itself by rest. Our Tarquin thus  <br>
Did softly press the rushes ere he waken'd <br>
The chastity he wounded. Cytherea,  <br>
How bravely thou becom'st thy bed! fresh lily,<br> 
And whiter than the sheets! That I might touch!<br>
But kiss: one kiss! Rubies unparagon'd, <br>
How dearly they do't! 'Tis her breathing that<br> 
Perfumes the chamber thus; the flame of the taper <br>
Bows toward her, and would under-peep her lids,  <br>
To see the enclosed lights, now canopied <br>
Under these windows, white and azure lac'd <br>
With blue of heaven's own tinct. But my design,<br> 
To note the chamber: I will write all down: <br>
Such and such pictures; there the window; such <br>
Th' adornment of her bed; the arras, figures, <br>
Why, such and such; and the contents o' the story.<br> 
Ah! but some natural notes about her body,  <br>
Above ten thousand meaner moveables <br>
Would testify, to enrich mine inventory.<br> 
O sleep! thou ape of death, lie dull upon her;<br> 
And be her senses but as a monument  <br>
Thus in a chapel lying. Come off, come off;.  [Taking off her bracelet.]<br> 
As slippery as the Gordian knot was hard! <br>
'Tis mine; and this will witness outwardly, <br>
As strongly as the conscience does within, <br>
To the madding of her lord. On her left breast <br>
A mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson drops <br>
I' the bottom of a cowslip: here's a voucher;  <br>
Stronger than ever law could make: this secret  <br>
Will force him think I have pick'd the lock and ta'en<br> 
The treasure of her honour. No more. To what end? <br>
Why should I write this down, that's riveted, <br>
Screw'd to my memory? She hath been reading late  <br>
The tale of Tereus; here the leaf's turn'd down <br>
Where Philomel gave up. I have enough: <br>
To the trunk again, and shut the spring of it.<br> 
Swift, swift, you dragons of the night, that dawning<br>  
May bare the raven's eye! I lodge in fear; <br>
Though this a heavenly angel, hell is here.  [Clock strikes.]<br>
One, two, three: time, time!  [Goes into the trunk. The scene closes.]<br>

Like a full-acorn'd boar, a German one, <br>
Cried 'O!' and mounted; found no opposition <br>
But what he look'd for should oppose and she <br>
Should from encounter guard. Could I find out  <br>
The woman's part in me! For there's no motion   <br>
That tends to vice in man but I affirm  <br>
It is the woman's part; be it lying, note it,
The woman's; flattering, hers; deceiving, hers; <br>
Lust and rank thoughts, hers, hers; revenges, hers; <br>
Ambitions, covetings, change of prides, disdain, <br>
Nice longing, slanders, mutability,  <br>
All faults that man may name, nay, that hell knows,<br> 
Why, hers, in part, or all; but rather, all;  <br>
For even to vice <br>
They are not constant, but are changing still
One vice but of a minute old for one <br>
Not half so old as that. I'll write against them,<br> 
Detest them, curse them. Yet 'tis greater skill <br>
In a true hate to pray they have their will:  <br>
The very devils cannot plague them better.  [Exit.]<br>

Richer than doing nothing for a bribe, <br>

Must curtsy at the censure: O boys! this story  <br>
The world may read in me; my body's mark'd <br>
With Roman swords, and my report was once <br>
First with the best of note; Cymbeline lov'd me,<br>
And when a soldier was the theme, my name <br>
Was not far off; then was I as a tree <br>
Whose boughs did bend with fruit, but, in one night,<br> 
A storm or robbery, call it what you will,  <br>
Shook down my mellow hangings, nay, my leaves, <br>
And left me bare to weather. <br>
  <br>
<del>Gui.        Uncertain favour!</del> <br>
<br>
Bel.  My fault being nothing,'as I have told you oft,'  <br>
But that two villains, whose false oaths prevail'd  <br>
Before my perfect honour, swore to Cymbeline <br>
I was confederate with the Romans; <br>
Follow'd my banishment, and this twenty years<br>
This rock and these demesnes have been my world,<br> 
Where I have liv'd at honest freedom, paid <br>
More pious debts to heaven than in all <br>
The fore-end of my time. But, up to the mountains! <br>
This is not hunter's language. He that strikes <br>
The venison first shall be the lord o' the feast; <br>
To him the other two shall minister; <br>
And we will fear no poison which attends  
In place of greater state. I'll meet you in the valleys.  [Exeunt GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS.] <br>
How hard it is to hide the sparks of nature! <br>
These boys know little they are sons to the king; <br>
Nor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive.  <br>
They think they are mine; and, though train'd up thus meanly<br> 
I' the cave wherein they bow, their thoughts do hit <br>
The roofs of palaces, and nature prompts them <br>
In simple and low things to prince it much  <br>
Beyond the trick of others. This Polydore,   <br>
The heir of Cymbeline and Britain, who <br>
The king his father call'd Guiderius,'Jove! <br>
When on my three-foot stool I sit and tell  <br>
The war-like feats I have done, his spirits fly out<br> 
Into my story: say, 'Thus mine enemy fell, <br>
And thus I set my foot on 's neck;' even then <br>
The princely blood flows in his cheek, he sweats, <br>
Strains his young nerves, and puts himself in posture <br>
That acts my words. The younger brother, Cadwal,' <br>
Once Arviragus,'in as like a figure, <br>
Strikes life into my speech and shows much more <br>
His own conceiving. Hark! the game is rous'd. <br>
O Cymbeline! heaven and my conscience knows <br>
Thou didst unjustly banish me; whereon, <br>
At three and two years old, I stole these babes,<br>
Thinking to bar thee of succession, as <br>
Thou reft'st me of my lands. Euriphile, <br>
Thou wast their nurse; they took thee for their mother,<br> 
And every day do honour to her grave:  <br>
Myself, Belarius, that am Morgan call'd, <br>
They take for natural father. The game is up.  [Exit.]<br>

      Pitied nor hated, to the face of peril<br>
      Myself I'll dedicate. Let me make men know<br>
      More valour in me than my habits show.<br>
      Gods, put the strength o' the Leonati in me!<br>
      To shame the guise o' the world, I will begin<br>
      The fashion, less without and more within. <br>

          No blame be to you, sir; for all was lost,<br>
      But that the heavens fought: the king himself<br>
      Of his wings destitute, the army broken,<br>
      And but the backs of Britons seen, all flying<br>
      Through a straight lane; the enemy full-hearted, <br>
      Lolling the tongue with slaughtering, having work<br>
      More plentiful than tools to do't, struck down<br>
      Some mortally, some slightly touch'd, some falling<br>
      Merely through fear; that the straight pass was damm'd<br>
      With dead men hurt behind, and cowards living <br>
      To die with lengthen'd shame. <br>
<p>
    <del> Lord. Where was this lane? </del>
<p>
Close by the battle, ditch'd, and wall'd with turf;<br>
      Which gave advantage to an ancient soldier,<br>
      An honest one, I warrant; who deserved <br>
      So long a breeding as his white beard came to,<br>
      In doing this for's country: athwart the lane,<br>
      He, with two striplings-lads more like to run<br>
      The country base than to commit such slaughter<br>
      With faces fit for masks, or rather fairer <br>
      Than those for preservation cased, or shame.<br>
      Made good the passage; cried to those that fled,<br>
      'Our Britain s harts die flying, not our men:<br>
      To darkness fleet souls that fly backwards. Stand;<br>
      Or we are Romans and will give you that <br>
      Like beasts which you shun beastly, and may save,<br>
      But to look back in frown: stand, stand.'
      These three,<br>
      Three thousand confident, in act as many.<br>
      For three performers are the file when all <br>
      The rest do nothing.with this word 'Stand, stand,'<br>
      Accommodated by the place, more charming<br>
      With their own nobleness, which could have turn'd<br>
      A distaff to a lance, gilded pale looks,<br>
      Part shame, part spirit renew'd; that some, 
      turn'd coward<br>
      But by example.O, a sin in war,<br>
      Damn'd in the first beginners!--gan to look<br>
      The way that they did, and to grin like lions<br>
      Upon the pikes o' the hunters. Then began <br>
      A stop i' the chaser, a retire, anon<br>
      A rout, confusion thick; forthwith they fly<br>
      Chickens, the way which they stoop'd eagles; slaves,<br>
      The strides they victors made: and now our cowards,<br>
      Like fragments in hard voyages, became <br>
      The life o' the need: having found the backdoor open<br>
      Of the unguarded hearts, heavens, how they wound!<br>
      Some slain before; some dying; some their friends<br>
      O'er borne i' the former wave: ten, chased by one,<br>
      Are now each one the slaughter-man of twenty: <br>
      Those that would die or ere resist are grown<br>
      The mortal bugs o' the field. <br>
<p>
   <del> Lord. This was strange chance
      A narrow lane, an old man, and two boys. </del>
<p>
Nay, do not wonder at it: you are made <br>
      Rather to wonder at the things you hear<br>
      Than to work any. Will you rhyme upon't,<br>
      And vent it for a mockery? Here is one:<br>
      'Two boys, an old man twice a boy, a lane,<br>
      Preserved the Britons, was the Romans' bane.' <br>
<p>
   <del> Lord. Nay, be not angry, sir. </del>
<p>
'Lack, to what end?<br>
      Who dares not stand his foe, I'll be his friend;<br>
      For if he'll do as he is made to do,<br>
      I know he'll quickly fly my friendship too. <br>
      You have put me into rhyme. <br>

 His mistress' picture; which by his tongue<br>
 being made,<br>
 And then a mind put in't, either our brags<br>
 Were crack'd of kitchen-trolls, or his description<br>
 Proved us unspeaking sots. </p>

<del><b>Cymbeline.</b> Nay, nay, to the purpose.</del><br><br>

<b>Iachimo.</b> Your daughter's chastity‚Äîthere it begins.<br>
 He spake of her, as Dian had hot dreams,<br>
 And she alone were cold: whereat I, wretch,<br>
 Made scruple of his praise; and wager'd with him<br>
 Pieces of gold 'gainst this which then he wore<br>
 Upon his honour'd finger, to attain<br>
 In suit the place of's bed and win this ring<br>
 By hers and mine adultery. He, true knight,<br>
 No lesser of her honour confident<br>
 Than I did truly find her, stakes this ring;<br>
 And would so, had it been a carbuncle<br>
 Of Phoebus' wheel, and might so safely, had it<br>
 Been all the worth of's car. Away to Britain<br>
 Post I in this design: well may you, sir,<br>
 Remember me at court; where I was taught<br>
 Of your chaste daughter the wide difference<br>
 'Twixt amorous and villanous. Being thus quench'd<br>
 Of hope, not longing, mine Italian brain<br>
 'Gan in your duller Britain operate<br>
 Most vilely; for my vantage, excellent:<br>
 And, to be brief, my practise so prevail'd,<br>
 That I return'd with simular proof enough<br>
 To make the noble Leonatus mad,<br>
 By wounding his belief in her renown<br>
 With tokens thus, and thus; averting notes<br>
 Of chamber-hanging, pictures, this her bracelet,‚Äî<br>
 O cunning, how I got it!‚Äînay, some marks<br>
 Of secret on her person, that he could not<br>
 But think her bond of chastity quite crack'd,<br>
 I having ta'en the forfeit. Whereupon‚Äî<br>
 Methinks, I see him now‚Äî <br>

Itself, and all my treason; that I suffer'd<br>

Your highness knows. Their nurse, Euriphile,<br>
Whom for the theft I wedded, stole these children <br>
Upon my banishment: I moved her to't,<br>
Having received the punishment before,<br>
For that which I did then: beaten for loyalty<br>
Excited me to treason: their dear loss,<br>
The more of you 'twas felt, the more it shaped <br>
Unto my end of stealing them. But, gracious sir,<br>
Here are your sons again; and I must lose<br>
Two of the sweet'st companions in the world.<br>
The benediction of these covering heavens<br>
Fall on their heads like dew! for they are worthy <br>
To inlay heaven with stars.
