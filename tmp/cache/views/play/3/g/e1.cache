          Weeps she still, sayst thou? Dost thou think in time	 <br>
She will not quench, and let instructions enter	 <br>
Where folly now possesses? Do thou work:<br> 
When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son,<br>
I'll tell thee on the instant thou art then <br>
As great as is thy master; greater, for <br>
His fortunes all lie speechless, and his name <br>
Is at last gasp; return he cannot, nor <br>
Continue where he is; to shift his being <br>
Is to exchange one misery with another, <br>
And every day that comes comes to decay	 <br>
A day's work in him. What shalt thou expect, <br>
To be depender on a thing that leans, <br>
Who cannot be new built, nor has no friends,<br> 
So much as but to prop him? <br> 
[The QUEEN drops the box; PISANIO takes it up.]<br> 
Thou tak'st up
Thou know'st not what; but take it for thy labour:<br> 
It is a thing I made, which hath the king <br>
Five times redeem'd from death; I do not know <br>
What is more cordial: nay, I prithee, take it; <br>
It is an earnest of a further good <br>
That I mean to thee. Tell thy mistress how <br>
The case stands with her; do 't as from thyself. <br>
Think what a chance thou changest on, but think <br>
Thou hast thy mistress still, to boot, my son, <br>
Who shall take notice of thee. I'll move the king <br>
To any shape of thy preferment such  <br>
As thou'lt desire; and then myself, I chiefly,<br>
That set thee on to this desert, am bound <br>
To load thy merit richly. Call my women; <br>
Think on my words.  [Exit PISANIO.]<br> 
A sly and constant knave,   <br>
Not to be shak'd; the agent for his master,<br> 
And the remembrancer of her to hold  <br>
The hand-fast to her lord. I have given him that <br>
Which, if he take, shall quite unpeople her <br>
Of leigers for her sweet, and which she after, <br>
Except she bend her humour, shall be assur'd <br>
To taste of too' <br>
[Re-Enter PISANIO and Ladies']<br>
So, so;'well done, well done. <br>
The violets, cowslips, and the prime-roses<br> 
Bear to my closet. Fare thee well, Pisanio: <br>
Think on my words. <br>

But in a fainter kind:--O! not like me, <br>

Love's counsellor should fill the bores of hearing, <br>
To the smothering of the sense,--how far it is <br>
To this same blessed Milford; and, by the way, <br>
Tell me how Wales was made so happy as <br>
T' inherit such a haven; but, first of all, <br>
How we may steal from hence, and, for the gap <br>
That we shall make in time, from our hencegoing <br>
And our return, to excuse; but first, how get hence.<br>
Why should excuse be born or ere begot? <br>

          I see a man's life is a tedious one;<br>
I have tir'd myself, and for two nights together <br>
Have made the ground my bed; I should be sick <br>
But that my resolution helps me. Milford, <br>
When from the mountain-top Pisanio show'd thee,<br> 
Thou wast within a ken. O Jove! I think  <br>
Foundations fly the wretched; such, I mean, <br>
Where they should be reliev'd. Two beggars told me<br> 
I could not miss my way; will poor folks lie, <br>
That have afflictions on them, knowing 'tis  <br>
A punishment or trial? Yes; no wonder,  <br>
When rich ones scarce tell true. To lapse in fulness<br> 
Is sorer than to lie for need, and falsehood  <br>
Is worse in kings than beggars. My dear lord!  <br>
Thou art one o' the false ones. Now I think on thee, <br>
My hunger's gone, but even before I was <br>
At point to sink for food. But what is this?<br> 
Here is a path to 't; 'tis some savage hold;   <br>
I were best not call, I dare not call, yet famine, <br>
Ere clean it o'erthrow nature, makes it valiant. <br>
Plenty and peace breeds cowards, hardness ever <br>
Of hardiness is mother. Ho! Who's here?  <br>
If any thing that's civil, speak; if savage, <br>
Take or lend. Ho! No answer? Then I'll enter. <br>
Best draw my sword; and if mine enemy <br>
But fear the sword like me, he'll scarcely look on 't.<br>
Such a foe, good heavens! <br>

I have gone all night: Faith, I'll lie down and sleep.<br>

These flowers are like the pleasures of the world; <br>
This bloody man, the care on 't. I hope I dream; <br>
For so I thought I was a cave-keeper, <br>
And cook to honest creatures; but 'tis not so, 
'Twas but a bolt of nothing, shot at nothing, <br>
Which the brain makes of fumes. Our very eyes  <br>
Are sometimes like our judgments, blind. Good faith,<br>

Yet left in heaven as small a drop of pity  <br>
As a wren's eye, fear'd gods, a part of it!  <br>
The dream's here still; even when I wake, it is <br>
Without me, as within me; not imagin'd, felt. <br>
A headless man! The garments of Posthumus! <br>
I know the shape of 's leg, this is his hand, <br>
His foot Mercurial, his Martial thigh, <br>
The brawns of Hercules, but his Jovial face.<br> 
Murder in heaven? How! 'Tis gone. Pisanio, <br>
All curses madded Hecuba gave the Greeks, <br>
And mine to boot, be darted on thee! Thou, <br>
Conspir'd with that irregulous devil, Cloten, <br>
Hast here cut off my lord. To write and read<br>
Be henceforth treacherous! Damn'd Pisanio <br>
Hath with his forged letters, damn'd Pisanio, <br>
From this most bravest vessel of the world <br>
Struck the main-top! O Posthumus! alas! <br>
Where is thy head? where's that? Ay me! where's that?<br> 
Pisanio might have kill'd thee at the heart, <br>
And left this head on. How should this be? Pisanio?<br> 
'Tis he and Cloten; malice and lucre in them <br>
Have laid this woe here. O! 'tis pregnant, pregnant! <br>
The drug he gave me, which he said was precious <br>
And cordial to me, have I not found it  <br>
Murderous to the senses? That confirms it home;<br>
This is Pisanio's deed, and Cloten's: O! <br>
Give colour to my pale cheek with thy blood, <br>
That we the horrider may seem to those <br>
Which chance to find us. O! my lord, my lord.<br>[Falls on the body.]<br>

Will force him think I have pick'd the lock and ta'en<br>

Why should I write this down, that's riveted, <br>
Screw'd to my memory? She hath been reading late  <br>
The tale of Tereus; here the leaf's turn'd down <br>
Where Philomel gave up. I have enough: <br>
To the trunk again, and shut the spring of it.<br> 
Swift, swift, you dragons of the night, that dawning<br>  
May bare the raven's eye! I lodge in fear; <br>
Though this a heavenly angel, hell is here.  [Clock strikes.]<br>

Not half so old as that. I'll write against them,<br>

Whose boughs did bend with fruit, but, in one night,<br>

Follow'd my banishment, and this twenty years<br>

More pious debts to heaven than in all <br>
The fore-end of my time. But, up to the mountains! <br>
This is not hunter's language. He that strikes <br>
The venison first shall be the lord o' the feast; <br>
To him the other two shall minister; <br>
And we will fear no poison which attends  
In place of greater state. I'll meet you in the valleys.  [Exeunt GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS.] <br>
How hard it is to hide the sparks of nature! <br>
These boys know little they are sons to the king; <br>
Nor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive.  <br>
They think they are mine; and, though train'd up thus meanly<br> 
I' the cave wherein they bow, their thoughts do hit <br>
The roofs of palaces, and nature prompts them <br>
In simple and low things to prince it much  <br>
Beyond the trick of others. This Polydore,   <br>
The heir of Cymbeline and Britain, who <br>
The king his father call'd Guiderius,'Jove! <br>
When on my three-foot stool I sit and tell  <br>
The war-like feats I have done, his spirits fly out<br> 
Into my story: say, 'Thus mine enemy fell, <br>
And thus I set my foot on 's neck;' even then <br>
The princely blood flows in his cheek, he sweats, <br>
Strains his young nerves, and puts himself in posture <br>
That acts my words. The younger brother, Cadwal,' <br>
Once Arviragus,'in as like a figure, <br>
Strikes life into my speech and shows much more <br>
His own conceiving. Hark! the game is rous'd. <br>
O Cymbeline! heaven and my conscience knows <br>
Thou didst unjustly banish me; whereon, <br>
At three and two years old, I stole these babes,<br>
Thinking to bar thee of succession, as <br>
Thou reft'st me of my lands. Euriphile, <br>
Thou wast their nurse; they took thee for their mother,<br> 
And every day do honour to her grave:  <br>
Myself, Belarius, that am Morgan call'd, <br>
They take for natural father. The game is up.  [Exit.]<br>

      The noble Imogen to repent, and struck<br>
      Me, wretch more worth your vengeance. But, alack,<br>

      And make me blest to obey! I am brought hither<br>
      Among the Italian gentry, and to fight<br>
      Against my lady's kingdom: 'tis enough<br>
      That, Britain, I have kill'd thy mistress; peace!<br>
      I'll give no wound to thee. Therefore, good heavens,<br>
      Hear patiently my purpose: I'll disrobe me<br>
      Of these Italian weeds and suit myself<br>
      As does a Briton peasant: so I'll fight<br>
      Against the part I come with; so I'll die<br>
      For thee, O Imogen, even for whom my life<br>
      Is every breath a death; and thus, unknown,<br>
      Pitied nor hated, to the face of peril<br>
      Myself I'll dedicate. Let me make men know<br>
      More valour in me than my habits show.<br>
      Gods, put the strength o' the Leonati in me!<br>

      Of his wings destitute, the army broken,<br>
      And but the backs of Britons seen, all flying<br>
      Through a straight lane; the enemy full-hearted, <br>
      Lolling the tongue with slaughtering, having work<br>
      More plentiful than tools to do't, struck down<br>
      Some mortally, some slightly touch'd, some falling<br>
      Merely through fear; that the straight pass was damm'd<br>
      With dead men hurt behind, and cowards living <br>
      To die with lengthen'd shame. <br>
<p>
    <del> Lord. Where was this lane? </del>
<p>
Close by the battle, ditch'd, and wall'd with turf;<br>
      Which gave advantage to an ancient soldier,<br>
      An honest one, I warrant; who deserved <br>
      So long a breeding as his white beard came to,<br>
      In doing this for's country: athwart the lane,<br>
      He, with two striplings-lads more like to run<br>
      The country base than to commit such slaughter<br>
      With faces fit for masks, or rather fairer <br>
      Than those for preservation cased, or shame.<br>
      Made good the passage; cried to those that fled,<br>
      'Our Britain s harts die flying, not our men:<br>
      To darkness fleet souls that fly backwards. Stand;<br>
      Or we are Romans and will give you that <br>
      Like beasts which you shun beastly, and may save,<br>
      But to look back in frown: stand, stand.'
      These three,<br>
      Three thousand confident, in act as many.<br>
      For three performers are the file when all <br>
      The rest do nothing.with this word 'Stand, stand,'<br>
      Accommodated by the place, more charming<br>
      With their own nobleness, which could have turn'd<br>
      A distaff to a lance, gilded pale looks,<br>
      Part shame, part spirit renew'd; that some, 
      turn'd coward<br>
      But by example.O, a sin in war,<br>
      Damn'd in the first beginners!--gan to look<br>
      The way that they did, and to grin like lions<br>
      Upon the pikes o' the hunters. Then began <br>
      A stop i' the chaser, a retire, anon<br>
      A rout, confusion thick; forthwith they fly<br>
      Chickens, the way which they stoop'd eagles; slaves,<br>
      The strides they victors made: and now our cowards,<br>
      Like fragments in hard voyages, became <br>
      The life o' the need: having found the backdoor open<br>
      Of the unguarded hearts, heavens, how they wound!<br>
      Some slain before; some dying; some their friends<br>
      O'er borne i' the former wave: ten, chased by one,<br>
      Are now each one the slaughter-man of twenty: <br>
      Those that would die or ere resist are grown<br>
      The mortal bugs o' the field. <br>
<p>
   <del> Lord. This was strange chance
      A narrow lane, an old man, and two boys. </del>
<p>
Nay, do not wonder at it: you are made <br>
      Rather to wonder at the things you hear<br>
      Than to work any. Will you rhyme upon't,<br>
      And vent it for a mockery? Here is one:<br>
      'Two boys, an old man twice a boy, a lane,<br>
      Preserved the Britons, was the Romans' bane.' <br>
<p>
   <del> Lord. Nay, be not angry, sir. </del>
<p>
'Lack, to what end?<br>
      Who dares not stand his foe, I'll be his friend;<br>
      For if he'll do as he is made to do,<br>
      I know he'll quickly fly my friendship too. <br>

          <i>[Waking]</i>Sleep, thou hast been a grandsire, and begot<br>
A father to me; and thou hast created<br>
A mother and two brothers: but, O scorn!<br>
Gone! they went hence so soon as they were born:<br>
And so I am awake. Poor wretches that depend <br>
On greatness' favour dream as I have done,<br>
Wake and find nothing. But, alas, I swerve:<br>
Many dream not to find, neither deserve,<br>
And yet are steep'd in favours: so am I,<br>
That have this golden chance and know not why.<br>
What fairies haunt this ground? A book? O rare one!<br>
Be not, as is our fangled world, a garment<br>
Nobler than that it covers: let thy effects<br>
So follow, to be most unlike our courtiers,<br>
As good as promise. <br>
<i>[Reads]</i><br>
'When as a lion's whelp shall, to himself unknown,<br>
without seeking find, and be embraced by a piece of<br>
tender air; and when from a stately cedar shall be<br>
lopped branches, which, being dead many years, <br>
shall after revive, be jointed to the old stock and<br>
freshly grow; then shall Posthumus end his miseries,<br>
Britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty.'<br>
'Tis still a dream, or else such stuff as madmen<br>
Tongue and brain not; either both or nothing; 3300<br>
Or senseless speaking or a speaking such<br>
As sense cannot untie. Be what it is,<br>
The action of my life is like it, which<br>
I'll keep, if but for sympathy. <br>

Though he have served a Roman: save him, sir,<br>
And spare no blood beside. <br>

          <b>Iachimo.</b> Upon a time,—unhappy was the clock<br>
 That struck the hour!—it was in Rome,—accursed<br>
 The mansion where!—'twas at a feast,—O, would<br>
 Our viands had been poison'd, or at least <br>
 Those which I heaved to head!—the good Posthumus—<br>
 What should I say? he was too good to be<br>
 Where ill men were; and was the best of all<br>
 Amongst the rarest of good ones,—sitting sadly,<br>
 Hearing us praise our loves of Italy <br>
 For beauty that made barren the swell'd boast<br>
 Of him that best could speak, for feature, laming<br>
 The shrine of Venus, or straight-pight Minerva.<br>
 Postures beyond brief nature, for condition,<br>
 A shop of all the qualities that man <br>
 Loves woman for, besides that hook of wiving,<br>
 Fairness which strikes the eye— 
<br><br>
<del><b>Cymbeline.</b> I stand on fire:<br>
 Come to the matter.</del> <br><br>

<b>Iachimo.</b> All too soon I shall,<br>
 Unless thou wouldst grieve quickly. This Posthumus,<br>
 Most like a noble lord in love and one<br>
 That had a royal lover, took his hint;<br>
 And, not dispraising whom we praised,—therein<br>
 He was as calm as virtue—he began<br>
 His mistress' picture; which by his tongue<br>
 being made,<br>
 And then a mind put in't, either our brags<br>
 Were crack'd of kitchen-trolls, or his description<br>
 Proved us unspeaking sots. </p>

<del><b>Cymbeline.</b> Nay, nay, to the purpose.</del><br><br>

<b>Iachimo.</b> Your daughter's chastity—there it begins.<br>
 He spake of her, as Dian had hot dreams,<br>
 And she alone were cold: whereat I, wretch,<br>
 Made scruple of his praise; and wager'd with him<br>
 Pieces of gold 'gainst this which then he wore<br>
 Upon his honour'd finger, to attain<br>
 In suit the place of's bed and win this ring<br>
 By hers and mine adultery. He, true knight,<br>
 No lesser of her honour confident<br>
 Than I did truly find her, stakes this ring;<br>
 And would so, had it been a carbuncle<br>
 Of Phoebus' wheel, and might so safely, had it<br>
 Been all the worth of's car. Away to Britain<br>
 Post I in this design: well may you, sir,<br>
 Remember me at court; where I was taught<br>
 Of your chaste daughter the wide difference<br>
 'Twixt amorous and villanous. Being thus quench'd<br>
 Of hope, not longing, mine Italian brain<br>
 'Gan in your duller Britain operate<br>
 Most vilely; for my vantage, excellent:<br>
 And, to be brief, my practise so prevail'd,<br>
 That I return'd with simular proof enough<br>
 To make the noble Leonatus mad,<br>
 By wounding his belief in her renown<br>
 With tokens thus, and thus; averting notes<br>
 Of chamber-hanging, pictures, this her bracelet,—<br>
 O cunning, how I got it!—nay, some marks<br>
 Of secret on her person, that he could not<br>
 But think her bond of chastity quite crack'd,<br>
 I having ta'en the forfeit. Whereupon—<br>
 Methinks, I see him now— <br>

Fall on their heads like dew! for they are worthy <br>
