          Weeps she still, sayst thou? Dost thou think in time	 <br>
She will not quench, and let instructions enter	 <br>
Where folly now possesses? Do thou work:<br> 
When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son,<br>
I'll tell thee on the instant thou art then <br>
As great as is thy master; greater, for <br>
His fortunes all lie speechless, and his name <br>
Is at last gasp; return he cannot, nor <br>
Continue where he is; to shift his being <br>
Is to exchange one misery with another, <br>
And every day that comes comes to decay	 <br>
A day's work in him. What shalt thou expect, <br>
To be depender on a thing that leans, <br>
Who cannot be new built, nor has no friends,<br> 
So much as but to prop him? <br> 
[The QUEEN drops the box; PISANIO takes it up.]<br> 
Thou tak'st up
Thou know'st not what; but take it for thy labour:<br> 
It is a thing I made, which hath the king <br>
Five times redeem'd from death; I do not know <br>
What is more cordial: nay, I prithee, take it; <br>
It is an earnest of a further good <br>
That I mean to thee. Tell thy mistress how <br>
The case stands with her; do 't as from thyself. <br>
Think what a chance thou changest on, but think <br>
Thou hast thy mistress still, to boot, my son, <br>
Who shall take notice of thee. I'll move the king <br>
To any shape of thy preferment such  <br>
As thou'lt desire; and then myself, I chiefly,<br>
That set thee on to this desert, am bound <br>
To load thy merit richly. Call my women; <br>
Think on my words.  [Exit PISANIO.]<br> 
A sly and constant knave,   <br>
Not to be shak'd; the agent for his master,<br> 
And the remembrancer of her to hold  <br>
The hand-fast to her lord. I have given him that <br>
Which, if he take, shall quite unpeople her <br>
Of leigers for her sweet, and which she after, <br>
Except she bend her humour, shall be assur'd <br>
To taste of too' <br>
[Re-Enter PISANIO and Ladies']<br>
So, so;'well done, well done. <br>
The violets, cowslips, and the prime-roses<br> 
Bear to my closet. Fare thee well, Pisanio: <br>
Think on my words. <br>

How we may steal from hence, and, for the gap <br>
That we shall make in time, from our hencegoing <br>
And our return, to excuse; but first, how get hence.<br>
Why should excuse be born or ere begot? <br>

          I see a man's life is a tedious one;<br>
I have tir'd myself, and for two nights together <br>
Have made the ground my bed; I should be sick <br>
But that my resolution helps me. Milford, <br>
When from the mountain-top Pisanio show'd thee,<br> 
Thou wast within a ken. O Jove! I think  <br>
Foundations fly the wretched; such, I mean, <br>
Where they should be reliev'd. Two beggars told me<br> 
I could not miss my way; will poor folks lie, <br>
That have afflictions on them, knowing 'tis  <br>
A punishment or trial? Yes; no wonder,  <br>
When rich ones scarce tell true. To lapse in fulness<br> 
Is sorer than to lie for need, and falsehood  <br>
Is worse in kings than beggars. My dear lord!  <br>
Thou art one o' the false ones. Now I think on thee, <br>
My hunger's gone, but even before I was <br>
At point to sink for food. But what is this?<br> 
Here is a path to 't; 'tis some savage hold;   <br>
I were best not call, I dare not call, yet famine, <br>
Ere clean it o'erthrow nature, makes it valiant. <br>
Plenty and peace breeds cowards, hardness ever <br>
Of hardiness is mother. Ho! Who's here?  <br>
If any thing that's civil, speak; if savage, <br>
Take or lend. Ho! No answer? Then I'll enter. <br>
Best draw my sword; and if mine enemy <br>
But fear the sword like me, he'll scarcely look on 't.<br>
Such a foe, good heavens! <br>

          Yes, sir, to Milford-Haven; which is the way? <br>
I thank you. By yond bush? Pray, how far thither? <br>
'Ods pittikins! can it be six mile yet? <br>
I have gone all night: Faith, I'll lie down and sleep.<br> 
[Seeing the body of CLOTEN.]<br> But, soft! no bed-fellow! O gods and goddesses!<br> 
These flowers are like the pleasures of the world; <br>
This bloody man, the care on 't. I hope I dream; <br>
For so I thought I was a cave-keeper, <br>
And cook to honest creatures; but 'tis not so, 
'Twas but a bolt of nothing, shot at nothing, <br>
Which the brain makes of fumes. Our very eyes  <br>
Are sometimes like our judgments, blind. Good faith,<br> 
I tremble still with fear; but if there be <br>
Yet left in heaven as small a drop of pity  <br>
As a wren's eye, fear'd gods, a part of it!  <br>
The dream's here still; even when I wake, it is <br>
Without me, as within me; not imagin'd, felt. <br>
A headless man! The garments of Posthumus! <br>
I know the shape of 's leg, this is his hand, <br>
His foot Mercurial, his Martial thigh, <br>
The brawns of Hercules, but his Jovial face.<br> 
Murder in heaven? How! 'Tis gone. Pisanio, <br>
All curses madded Hecuba gave the Greeks, <br>
And mine to boot, be darted on thee! Thou, <br>
Conspir'd with that irregulous devil, Cloten, <br>
Hast here cut off my lord. To write and read<br>
Be henceforth treacherous! Damn'd Pisanio <br>
Hath with his forged letters, damn'd Pisanio, <br>
From this most bravest vessel of the world <br>
Struck the main-top! O Posthumus! alas! <br>
Where is thy head? where's that? Ay me! where's that?<br> 
Pisanio might have kill'd thee at the heart, <br>
And left this head on. How should this be? Pisanio?<br> 
'Tis he and Cloten; malice and lucre in them <br>
Have laid this woe here. O! 'tis pregnant, pregnant! <br>
The drug he gave me, which he said was precious <br>
And cordial to me, have I not found it  <br>
Murderous to the senses? That confirms it home;<br>
This is Pisanio's deed, and Cloten's: O! <br>
Give colour to my pale cheek with thy blood, <br>
That we the horrider may seem to those <br>
Which chance to find us. O! my lord, my lord.<br>[Falls on the body.]<br>

          O rare instinct!  <br>
When shall I hear all through? This fierce abridgment <br>
Hath to it circumstantial branches, which <br>
Distinction should be rich in. Where? how liv'd you?<br> 
And when came you to serve our Roman captive?<br>
How parted with your brothers? how first met them?<br> 
Why fled you from the court, and whither? These, <br>
And your three motives to the battle, with <br>
I know not how much more, should be demanded, <br>
And all the other by-dependances, <br>
From chance to chance, but nor the time nor place<br> 
Will serve our long inter'gatories. See, <br>
Posthumus anchors upon Imogen, <br>
And she, like harmless lightning, throws her eye<br> 
On him, her brothers, me, her master, hitting <br>
Each object with a joy: the counterchange <br>
Is severally in all. Let's quit this ground, <br>
And smoke the temple with our sacrifices.<br>
