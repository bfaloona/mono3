          <b>Prospero.</b> My brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio‚Äî <br>
 I pray thee, mark me‚Äîthat a brother should<br>
 Be so perfidious!‚Äîhe whom next thyself<br>
 Of all the world I loved and to him put<br>
 The manage of my state; as at that time<br>
 Through all the signories it was the first <br>
 And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed<br>
 In dignity, and for the liberal arts<br>
 Without a parallel; those being all my study,<br>
 The government I cast upon my brother<br>
 And to my state grew stranger, being transported <br>
 And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle‚Äî<br>
 Dost thou attend me? <br>
<br>
<del><b>Miranda.</b> Sir, most heedfully.</del> <br>
<br>
<b>Prospero.</b> Being once perfected how to grant suits,<br>
 How to deny them, who to advance and who <br>
 To trash for over-topping, new created<br>
 The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed 'em,<br>
 Or else new form'd 'em; having both the key<br>
 Of officer and office, set all hearts i' the state<br>
 To what tune pleased his ear; that now he was<br>
 The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,<br>
 And suck'd my verdure out on't. Thou attend'st not. <br>
<br>
<del><b>Miranda.</b> O, good sir, I do.</del> <br>
<br>
<b>Prospero.</b> I pray thee, mark me.<br>
 I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated <br>
 To closeness and the bettering of my mind<br>
 With that which, but by being so retired,<br>
 O'er-prized all popular rate, in my false brother<br>
 Awaked an evil nature; and my trust,<br>
 Like a good parent, did beget of him <br>
 A falsehood in its contrary as great<br>
 As my trust was; which had indeed no limit,<br>
 A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,<br>
 Not only with what my revenue yielded,<br>
 But what my power might else exact, like one <br>
 Who having into truth, by telling of it,<br>
 Made such a sinner of his memory,<br>
 To credit his own lie, he did believe<br>
 He was indeed the duke; out o' the substitution<br>
 And executing the outward face of royalty, <br>
 With all prerogative: hence his ambition growing‚Äî<br>
 Dost thou hear? <br>
<br>
 * Miranda. Your tale, sir, would cure deafness. <br>
<br>
 * Prospero. To have no screen between this part he play'd<br>
 And him he play'd it for, he needs will be <br>
 Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library<br>
 Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties<br>
 He thinks me now incapable; confederates‚Äî<br>
 So dry he was for sway‚Äîwi' the King of Naples<br>
 To give him annual tribute, do him homage, <br>
 Subject his coronet to his crown and bend<br>
 The dukedom yet unbow'd‚Äîalas, poor Milan!‚Äî<br>
 To most ignoble stooping.

bombard that would shed his liquor. If it should thunder as it did before, I know not
where to hide my head: yond same cloud cannot
choose but fall by pailfuls. What have we
here? a man or a fish? dead or alive? A fish:
he smells like a fish; a very ancient and fish-like smell; a kind of not of the newest Poor-John. A strange fish! Were I in England now,
as once I was, and had but this fish painted,
not a holiday fool there but would give a piece
of silver: there would this monster make a 
man; any strange beast there makes a man:
when they will not give a doit to relieve a lame
beggar, they will lazy out ten to see a dead
Indian. Legged like a man and his fins like
arms! Warm o' my troth! I do now let loose 
my opinion; hold it no longer: this is no fish,
but an islander, that hath lately suffered by a
thunderbolt.
[Thunder]
Alas, the storm is come again! my best way is to 
creep under his gaberdine; there is no other
shelter hereabouts: misery acquaints a man with
strange bed-fellows. I will here shroud till the
dregs of the storm be past.

          Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes and groves,<br>
And ye that on the sands with printless foot <br>
Do chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him<br>
When he comes back; you demi-puppets that<br>
By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,<br>
Whereof the ewe not bites, and you whose pastime<br>
Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice <br>
To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid,<br>
Weak masters though ye be, I have bedimm'd<br>
The noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds,<br>
And 'twixt the green sea and the azured vault<br>
Set roaring war: to the dread rattling thunder<br>
Have I given fire and rifted Jove's stout oak<br>
With his own bolt; the strong-based promontory<br>
Have I made shake and by the spurs pluck'd up<br>
The pine and cedar: graves at my command<br>
Have waked their sleepers, oped, and let 'em forth <br>
By my so potent art. But this rough magic<br>
I here abjure, and, when I have required<br>
Some heavenly music, which even now I do,<br>
To work mine end upon their senses that<br>
This airy charm is for, I'll break my staff, <br>
Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,<br>
And deeper than did ever plummet sound<br>
I'll drown my book. <br>
