To be commenced in strands afar remote.<br>
No more the thirsty entrance of this soil<br>
Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood;<br>
Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields,<br>
Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs<br>
Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes,<br>
Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,<br>
All of one nature, of one substance bred,<br>
Did lately meet in the intestine shock<br>
And furious close of civil butchery<br>
Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks, <br>
March all one way and be no more opposed<br>
Against acquaintance, kindred and allies:<br>
The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,<br>
No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,<br>
As far as to the sepulchre of Christ, <br>
Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross<br>
We are impressed and engaged to fight,<br>
Forthwith a power of English shall we levy;<br>
Whose arms were moulded in their mothers' womb<br>
To chase these pagans in those holy fields <br>
Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet<br>
Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd<br>
For our advantage on the bitter cross.<br>
But this our purpose now is twelve month old,<br>
And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go: <br>
Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear<br>
Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,<br>
What yesternight our council did decree<br>
In forwarding this dear expedience. <br>

But I remember, when the fight was done, <br>
When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,<br>
Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,<br>
Came there a certain lord, neat, and trimly dress'd,<br>
Fresh as a bridegroom; and his chin new reap'd<br>
Show'd like a stubble-land at harvest-home; <br>
He was perfumed like a milliner;<br>
And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held<br>
A pouncet-box, which ever and anon<br>
He gave his nose and took't away again;<br>
Who therewith angry, when it next came there,<br>
Took it in snuff; and still he smiled and talk'd,<br>
And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,<br>
He call'd them untaught knaves, unmannerly,<br>
To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse<br>
Betwixt the wind and his nobility. <br>
With many holiday and lady terms<br>
He question'd me; amongst the rest, demanded<br>
My prisoners in your majesty's behalf.<br>
I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold,<br>
To be so pester'd with a popinjay, <br>
Out of my grief and my impatience,<br>
Answer'd neglectingly I know not what,<br>
He should or he should not; for he made me mad<br>
To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet<br>
And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman <br>
Of guns and drums and wounds,.God save the mark!--<br>
And telling me the sovereign'st thing on earth<br>
Was parmaceti for an inward bruise;<br>
And that it was great pity, so it was,<br>
This villanous salt-petre should be digg'd <br>
Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,<br>
Which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd<br>
So cowardly; and but for these vile guns,<br>
He would himself have been a soldier.<br>
This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,<br>
I answer'd indirectly, as I said;<br>
And I beseech you, let not his report<br>
Come current for an accusation<br>
Betwixt my love and your high majesty.

          With three or four loggerheads amongst three or four<br>
score hogsheads. I have sounded the very<br>
base-string of humility. Sirrah, I am sworn brother<br>
to a leash of drawers; and can call them all by<br>
their christen names, as Tom, Dick, and Francis.<br>
They take it already upon their salvation, that<br>
though I be but the prince of Wales, yet I am king<br>
of courtesy; and tell me flatly I am no proud Jack,<br>
like Falstaff, but a Corinthian, a lad of mettle, a<br>
good boy, by the Lord, so they call me, and when I<br>
am king of England, I shall command all the good<br>
lads in Eastcheap. They call drinking deep, dyeing<br>
scarlet; and when you breathe in your watering, they<br>
cry 'hem!' and bid you play it off. To conclude, I<br>
am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour,<br>
that I can drink with any tinker in his own language<br>
during my life. I tell thee, Ned, thou hast lost<br>
much honour, that thou wert not with me in this sweet<br>
action. But, sweet Ned,.to sweeten which name of<br>
Ned, I give thee this pennyworth of sugar, clapped<br>
even now into my hand by an under-skinker, one that<br>
never spake other English in his life than 'Eight<br>
shillings and sixpence' and 'You are welcome,' with<br>
this shrill addition, 'Anon, anon, sir! Score a pint<br>
of bastard in the Half-Moon,' or so. But, Ned, to<br>
drive away the time till Falstaff come, I prithee,<br>
do thou stand in some by-room, while I question my<br>
puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar; and do<br>
thou never leave calling 'Francis,' that his tale<br>
to me may be nothing but 'Anon.' Step aside, and<br>
I'll show thee a precedent.

          <b>Falstaff.</b> Peace, good pint-pot; peace, good tickle-brain.<br>
      Harry, I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy<br>
      time, but also how thou art accompanied: for though<br>
      the camomile, the more it is trodden on the faster<br>
      it grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted the<br>
      sooner it wears. That thou art my son, I have<br>
      partly thy mother's word, partly my own opinion,<br>
      but chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye and a<br>
      foolish-hanging of thy nether lip, that doth warrant<br>
      me. If then thou be son to me, here lies the point;<br>
      why, being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall<br>
      the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat<br>
      blackberries? a question not to be asked. Shall<br>
      the sun of England prove a thief and take purses? a<br>
      question to be asked. There is a thing, Harry,<br>
      which thou hast often heard of and it is known to<br>
      many in our land by the name of pitch: this pitch,<br>
      as ancient writers do report, doth defile; so doth<br>
      the company thou keepest: for, Harry, now I do not<br>
      speak to thee in drink but in tears, not in<br>
      pleasure but in passion, not in words only, but in<br>
      woes also: and yet there is a virtuous man whom I<br>
      have often noted in thy company, but I know not his name. <br><br>

<del><b>Henry V.</b> What manner of man, an it like your majesty?</del><br><br>

<b>Falstaff.</b> A goodly portly man, i' faith, and a corpulent; of a
      cheerful look, a pleasing eye and a most noble<br>
      carriage; and, as I think, his age some fifty, or,<br>
      by'r lady, inclining to three score; and now I<br>
      remember me, his name is Falstaff: if that man<br>
      should be lewdly given, he deceiveth me; for, Harry,<br>
      I see virtue in his looks. If then the tree may be<br>
      known by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, then,<br>
      peremptorily I speak it, there is virtue in that<br>
      Falstaff: him keep with, the rest banish. And tell<br>
      me now, thou naughty varlet, tell me, where hast<br>
      thou been this month?<br><br>

<del><b>Henry V.</b> Dost thou speak like a king? Do thou stand for me,
      and I'll play my father.</del> <br><br>

<b>Falstaff.</b> Depose me? if thou dost it half so gravely, so<br>
      majestically, both in word and matter, hang me up by<br>
      the heels for a rabbit-sucker or a poulter's hare.

          God pardon thee! yet let me wonder, Harry,<br>
At thy affections, which do hold a wing<br>
Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors.<br>
Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost.<br>
Which by thy younger brother is supplied,<br>
And art almost an alien to the hearts<br>
Of all the court and princes of my blood:<br>
The hope and expectation of thy time<br>
Is ruin'd, and the soul of every man <br>
Prophetically doth forethink thy fall.<br>
Had I so lavish of my presence been,<br>
So common-hackney'd in the eyes of men,<br>
So stale and cheap to vulgar company,<br>
Opinion, that did help me to the crown,<br>
Had still kept loyal to possession<br>
And left me in reputeless banishment,<br>
A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.<br>
By being seldom seen, I could not stir<br>
But like a comet I was wonder'd at;<br>
That men would tell their children 'This is he;'<br>
Others would say 'Where, which is Bolingbroke?'<br>
And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,<br>
And dress'd myself in such humility<br>
That I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts, <br>
Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths,<br>
Even in the presence of the crowned king.<br>
Thus did I keep my person fresh and new;<br>
My presence, like a robe pontifical,<br>
Ne'er seen but wonder'd at: and so my state,<br>
Seldom but sumptuous, showed like a feast<br>
And won by rareness such solemnity.<br>
The skipping king, he ambled up and down<br>
With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits,<br>
Soon kindled and soon burnt; carded his state,<br>
Mingled his royalty with capering fools,<br>
Had his great name profaned with their scorns<br>
And gave his countenance, against his name,<br>
To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push<br>
Of every beardless vain comparative,<br>
Grew a companion to the common streets,<br>
Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;<br>
That, being daily swallow'd by men's eyes,<br>
They surfeited with honey and began<br>
To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little <br>
More than a little is by much too much.<br>
So when he had occasion to be seen,<br>
He was but as the cuckoo is in June,<br>
Heard, not regarded; seen, but with such eyes<br>
As, sick and blunted with community, <br>
Afford no extraordinary gaze,<br>
Such as is bent on sun-like majesty<br>
When it shines seldom in admiring eyes;<br>
But rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down,<br>
Slept in his face and render'd such aspect <br>
As cloudy men use to their adversaries,<br>
Being with his presence glutted, gorged and full.<br>
And in that very line, Harry, standest thou;<br>
For thou has lost thy princely privilege<br>
With vile participation: not an eye<br>
But is a-weary of thy common sight,<br>
Save mine, which hath desired to see thee more;<br>
Which now doth that I would not have it do,<br>
Make blind itself with foolish tenderness.

To dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns,<br>
To show how much thou art degenerate.

          If I be not ashamed of my soldiers, I am a soused
gurnet. I have misused the king's press damnably.
I have got, in exchange of a hundred and fifty 
soldiers, three hundred and odd pounds. I press me
none but good house-holders, yeoman's sons; inquire
me out contracted bachelors, such as had been asked
twice on the banns; such a commodity of warm slaves,
as had as lieve hear the devil as a drum; such as
fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck
fowl or a hurt wild-duck. I pressed me none but such
toasts-and-butter, with hearts in their bellies no
bigger than pins' heads, and they have bought out
their services; and now my whole charge consists of 
ancients, corporals, lieutenants, gentlemen of
companies, slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the
painted cloth, where the glutton's dogs licked his
sores; and such as indeed were never soldiers, but
discarded unjust serving-men, younger sons to 
younger brothers, revolted tapsters and ostlers
trade-fallen, the cankers of a calm world and a
long peace, ten times more dishonourable ragged than
an old faced ancient: and such have I, to fill up
the rooms of them that have bought out their 
services, that you would think that I had a hundred
and fifty tattered prodigals lately come from
swine-keeping, from eating draff and husks. A mad
fellow met me on the way and told me I had unloaded
all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies. No eye
hath seen such scarecrows. I'll not march through
Coventry with them, that's flat: nay, and the
villains march wide betwixt the legs, as if they had
gyves on; for indeed I had the most of them out of
prison. There's but a shirt and a half in all my 
company; and the half shirt is two napkins tacked
together and thrown over the shoulders like an
herald's coat without sleeves; and the shirt, to say
the truth, stolen from my host at Saint Alban's, or
the red-nose innkeeper of Daventry. But that's all
one; they'll find linen enough on every hedge.

      And when he heard him swear and vow to God<br>
      He came but to be Duke of Lancaster, <br>
      To sue his livery and beg his peace,<br>
      With tears of innocency and terms of zeal,<br>
      My father, in kind heart and pity moved,<br>
      Swore him assistance and perform'd it too.<br>
      Now when the lords and barons of the realm <br>
      Perceived Northumberland did lean to him,<br>
      The more and less came in with cap and knee;<br>
      Met him in boroughs, cities, villages,<br>
      Attended him on bridges, stood in lanes,<br>
      Laid gifts before him, proffer'd him their oaths,<br>
      Gave him their heirs, as pages follow'd him<br>
      Even at the heels in golden multitudes.<br>
      He presently, as greatness knows itself,<br>
      Steps me a little higher than his vow<br>
      Made to my father, while his blood was poor,<br>
      Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh;<br>
      And now, forsooth, takes on him to reform<br>
      Some certain edicts and some strait decrees<br>
      That lie too heavy on the commonwealth,<br>
      Cries out upon abuses, seems to weep <br>
      Over his country's wrongs; and by this face,<br>
      This seeming brow of justice, did he win<br>
      The hearts of all that he did angle for;<br>
      Proceeded further; cut me off the heads<br>
      Of all the favourites that the absent king <br>
      In deputation left behind him here,<br>
      When he was personal in the Irish war. <br><br>

<del><b>Blunt.</b> Tut, I came not to hear this.</del> <br><br>

<b>Hotspur (Henry Percy).</b> Then to the point.<br>
      In short time after, he deposed the king; <br>
      Soon after that, deprived him of his life;<br>
      And in the neck of that, task'd the whole state:<br>
      To make that worse, suffer'd his kinsman March,<br>
      Who is, if every owner were well placed,<br>
      Indeed his king, to be engaged in Wales, <br>
      There without ransom to lie forfeited;<br>
      Disgraced me in my happy victories,<br>
      Sought to entrap me by intelligence;<br>
      Rated mine uncle from the council-board;<br>
      In rage dismiss'd my father from the court; <br>
      Broke oath on oath, committed wrong on wrong,<br>
      And in conclusion drove us to seek out<br>
      This head of safety; and withal to pry<br>
      Into his title, the which we find<br>
      Too indirect for long continuance. <br><br>

<del><b>Blunt.</b> Shall I return this answer to the king?</del> <br><br>

<b>Hotspur (Henry Percy).</b> Not so, Sir Walter: we'll withdraw awhile.<br>
      Go to the king; and let there be impawn'd<br>
      Some surety for a safe return again,<br>
      And in the morning early shall my uncle <br>
      Bring him our purposes: and so farewell.

          It pleased your majesty to turn your looks<br>
Of favour from myself and all our house;<br>
And yet I must remember you, my lord, <br>
We were the first and dearest of your friends.<br>
For you my staff of office did I break<br>
In Richard's time; and posted day and night<br>
to meet you on the way, and kiss your hand,<br>
When yet you were in place and in account<br>
Nothing so strong and fortunate as I.<br>
It was myself, my brother and his son,<br>
That brought you home and boldly did outdare<br>
The dangers of the time. You swore to us,<br>
And you did swear that oath at Doncaster,<br>
That you did nothing purpose 'gainst the state;<br>
Nor claim no further than your new-fall'n right,<br>
The seat of Gaunt, dukedom of Lancaster:<br>
To this we swore our aid. But in short space<br>
It rain'd down fortune showering on your head;<br>
And such a flood of greatness fell on you,<br>
What with our help, what with the absent king,<br>
What with the injuries of a wanton time,<br>
The seeming sufferances that you had borne,<br>
And the contrarious winds that held the king <br>
So long in his unlucky Irish wars<br>
That all in England did repute him dead:<br>
And from this swarm of fair advantages<br>
You took occasion to be quickly woo'd<br>
To gripe the general sway into your hand;<br>
Forget your oath to us at Doncaster;<br>
And being fed by us you used us so<br>
As that ungentle hull, the cuckoo's bird,<br>
Useth the sparrow; did oppress our nest;<br>
Grew by our feeding to so great a bulk<br>
That even our love durst not come near your sight<br>
For fear of swallowing; but with nimble wing<br>
We were enforced, for safety sake, to fly<br>
Out of sight and raise this present head;<br>
Whereby we stand opposed by such means <br>
As you yourself have forged against yourself<br>
By unkind usage, dangerous countenance,<br>
And violation of all faith and troth<br>
Sworn to us in your younger enterprise.

no. Why? detraction will not suffer it. Therefore
