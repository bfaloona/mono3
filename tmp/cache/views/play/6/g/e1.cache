an oak but with one green leaf on it would have
answered her; my very visor began to assume life and
scold with her. She told me, not thinking I had been
myself, that I was the prince's jester, that I was
duller than a great thaw; huddling jest upon jest 
with such impossible conveyance upon me that I stood
like a man at a mark, with a whole army shooting at
me. She speaks poniards, and every word stabs:
if her breath were as terrible as her terminations,
there were no living near her; she would infect to 
the north star. I would not marry her, though she
were endowed with all that Adam bad left him before
he transgressed: she would have made Hercules have
turned spit, yea, and have cleft his club to make
the fire too. Come, talk not of her: you shall find 
her the infernal Ate in good apparel. I would to God
some scholar would conjure her; for certainly, while
she is here, a man may live as quiet in hell as in a
sanctuary; and people sin upon purpose, because they
would go thither; so, indeed, all disquiet, horror 
and perturbation follows her.

          This can be no trick: the
conference was sadly borne. They have the truth of
this from Hero. They seem to pity the lady: it
seems her affections have their full bent. Love me!
why, it must be requited. I hear how I am censured:
they say I will bear myself proudly, if I perceive
the love come from her; they say too that she will
rather die than give any sign of affection. I did
never think to marry: I must not seem proud: happy
are they that hear their detractions and can put 
them to mending. They say the lady is fair; 'tis a
truth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous; 'tis
so, I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving
me; by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor
no great argument of her folly, for I will be 
horribly in love with her. I may chance have some
odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me,
because I have railed so long against marriage: but
doth not the appetite alter? a man loves the meat
in his youth that he cannot endure in his age. 
Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of
the brain awe a man from the career of his humour?
No, the world must be peopled. When I said I would
die a bachelor, I did not think I should live till I
were married. Here comes Beatrice. By this day! 
she's a fair lady: I do spy some marks of love in
her.

      sometimes fashioning them like Pharaoh's soldiers
      in the reeky painting, sometime like god Bel's
      priests in the old church-window, sometime like the
      shaven Hercules in the smirched worm-eaten tapestry,
      where his codpiece seems as massy as his club? <br><br>

<del><b>Conrade.</b> All this I see; and I see that the fashion wears
      out more apparel than the man. But art not thou
      thyself giddy with the fashion too, that thou hast
      shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion? </del><br><br>

<b>Borachio.</b> Not so, neither: but know that I have to-night
      wooed Margaret, the Lady Hero's gentlewoman, by the
      name of Hero: she leans me out at her mistress'
      chamber-window, bids me a thousand times good
      night,.I tell this tale vilely:.I should first 
      tell thee how the prince, Claudio and my master,
      planted and placed and possessed by my master Don
      John, saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter. <br><br>

<del><b>Conrade.</b> And thought they Margaret was Hero?</del><br><br> 

<b>Borachio.</b> Two of them did, the prince and Claudio; but the 
      devil my master knew she was Margaret; and partly
      by his oaths, which first possessed them, partly by
      the dark night, which did deceive them, but chiefly
      by my villany, which did confirm any slander that
      Don John had made, away went Claudio enraged; swore 
      he would meet her, as he was appointed, next morning
      at the temple, and there, before the whole
      congregation, shame her with what he saw o'er night
      and send her home again without a husband.

      There, Leonato, take her back again:<br>
      Give not this rotten orange to your friend;<br>
      She's but the sign and semblance of her honour.<br>
      Behold how like a maid she blushes here!<br>
      O, what authority and show of truth<br>
      Can cunning sin cover itself withal!<br>
      Comes not that blood as modest evidence<br>
      To witness simple virtue? Would you not swear,<br>
      All you that see her, that she were a maid,<br>
      By these exterior shows? But she is none:<br>
      She knows the heat of a luxurious bed;<br>
      Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty. <br><br>

<del><b>Leonato.</b> What do you mean, my lord? </del><br><br>

<b>Claudio.</b> Not to be married,<br>
      Not to knit my soul to an approved wanton.<br><br>

<del><b>Leonato.</b> Dear my lord, if you, in your own proof,<br>
      Have vanquish'd the resistance of her youth,<br>
      And made defeat of her virginity,-- </del><br><br>

<b>Claudio.</b> I know what you would say: if I have known her,<br>
      You will say she did embrace me as a husband, <br>
      And so extenuate the 'forehand sin:<br>
      No, Leonato,<br>
      I never tempted her with word too large;<br>
      But, as a brother to his sister, show'd<br>
      Bashful sincerity and comely love.<br><br>

<del><b> Hero.</b> And seem'd I ever otherwise to you? </del><br><br>

<b>Claudio.</b> Out on thee! Seeming! I will write against it:<br>
      You seem to me as Dian in her orb,<br>
      As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown;<br>
      But you are more intemperate in your blood<br>
      Than Venus, or those pamper'd animals<br>
      That rage in savage sensuality. <br><br>

<del> <b>Hero.</b> Is my lord well, that he doth speak so wide?<br><br>

<b>Leonato.</b> Sweet prince, why speak not you? <br><br>

<b>Don Pedro.</b> What should I speak? <br>
      I stand dishonour'd, that have gone about<br>
      To link my dear friend to a common stale. <br><br>

<b>Leonato.</b> Are these things spoken, or do I but dream? <br><br>

<b>Don John.</b> Sir, they are spoken, and these things are true.<br><br> 

<b>Benedick.</b> This looks not like a nuptial. <br><br>

<b>Hero.</b> True! O God! </del><br><br>

<b>Claudio.</b> Leonato, stand I here?<br>
      Is this the prince? is this the prince's brother?<br>
      Is this face Hero's? are our eyes our own? <br><br>

<del><b>Leonato.</b> All this is so: but what of this, my lord?</del><br><br>

<b>Claudio.</b> Let me but move one question to your daughter;<br>
      And, by that fatherly and kindly power<br>
      That you have in her, bid her answer truly. <br><br>

<del><b>Leonato.</b> I charge thee do so, as thou art my child.<br><br> 

<b>Hero.</b> O, God defend me! how am I beset!<br>
      What kind of catechising call you this? </del><br><br>

<b>Claudio.</b> To make you answer truly to your name. <br><br>

<del><b>Hero.</b> Is it not Hero? Who can blot that name<br>
      With any just reproach? </del><br><br>

<del><b>Claudio.</b> Marry, that can Hero;</del><br>
      Hero itself can blot out Hero's virtue.<br>
      What man was he talk'd with you yesternight<br>
      Out at your window betwixt twelve and one?<br>
      <del>Now, if you are a maid, answer to this.</del> <br><br>

    <del><b>Hero.</b> I talk'd with no man at that hour, my lord.<br><br>

<b>Don Pedro.</b> Why, then are you no maiden. Leonato,<br>
      I am sorry you must hear: upon mine honour,<br>
      Myself, my brother and this grieved count<br>
      Did see her, hear her, at that hour last night<br>
      Talk with a ruffian at her chamber-window <br>
      Who hath indeed, most like a liberal villain,<br>
      Confess'd the vile encounters they have had<br>
      A thousand times in secret. <br><br>

    <b>Don John.</b> Fie, fie! they are not to be named, my lord,<br>
      Not to be spoke of; <br>
      There is not chastity enough in language<br>
      Without offence to utter them. Thus, pretty lady,<br>
      I am sorry for thy much misgovernment. </del><br><br>

<b>Claudio.</b> O Hero, what a Hero hadst thou been,<br>
      If half thy outward graces had been placed<br>
      About thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart!<br>
      But fare thee well, most foul, most fair! farewell,<br>
      Thou pure impiety and impious purity!<br>
      For thee I'll lock up all the gates of love,<br>
      And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang,<br>
      To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm,<br>
      And never shall it more be gracious.

As water in a sieve: give not me counsel;<br>
Nor let no comforter delight mine ear<br>
But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine.<br>
Bring me a father that so loved his child,<br>
Whose joy of her is overwhelm'd like mine,<br>
And bid him speak of patience;<br>
Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine<br>
And let it answer every strain for strain, <br>
As thus for thus and such a grief for such,<br>
In every lineament, branch, shape, and form:<br>
If such a one will smile and stroke his beard,<br>
Bid sorrow wag, cry 'hem!' when he should groan,<br>
Patch grief with proverbs, make misfortune drunk<br>
With candle-wasters; bring him yet to me,<br>
And I of him will gather patience.<br>
But there is no such man: for, brother, men<br>
Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief<br>
Which they themselves not feel; but, tasting it,<br>
Their counsel turns to passion, which before<br>
Would give preceptial medicine to rage,<br>
Fetter strong madness in a silken thread,<br>
Charm ache with air and agony with words:<br>
No, no; 'tis all men's office to speak patience <br>
To those that wring under the load of sorrow,<br>
But no man's virtue nor sufficiency<br>
To be so moral when he shall endure<br>
The like himself. Therefore give me no counsel:<br>
My griefs cry louder than advertisement.

do you hear me, and let this count kill me. I have
deceived even your very eyes: what your wisdoms
could not discover, these shallow fools have brought
to light: who in the night overheard me confessing
to this man how Don John your brother incensed me
to slander the Lady Hero, how you were brought into
the orchard and saw me court Margaret in Hero's
garments, how you disgraced her, when you should 
marry her: my villany they have upon record; which
I had rather seal with my death than repeat over
to my shame. The lady is dead upon mine and my
master's false accusation; and, briefly, I desire
nothing but the reward of a villain.

          I do much wonder that one man, seeing how much 
another man is a fool when he dedicates his 
behaviors to love, will, after he hath laughed at 
such shallow follies in others, become the argument 
of his own scorn by failing in love: and such a man 
is Claudio. I have known when there was no music 
with him but the drum and the fife; and now had he 
rather hear the tabour and the pipe: I have known 
when he would have walked ten mile a-foot to see a 
good armour; and now will he lie ten nights awake,  
carving the fashion of a new doublet. He was wont to 
speak plain and to the purpose, like an honest man 
and a soldier; and now is he turned orthography; his 
words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many 
strange dishes. May I be so converted and see with  
these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not: I will not 
be sworn, but love may transform me to an oyster; but 
I'll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster 
of me, he shall never make me such a fool. One woman 
is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I am  
well; another virtuous, yet I am well; but till all 
graces be in one woman, one woman shall not come in 
my grace. Rich she shall be, that's certain; wise, 
or I'll none; virtuous, or I'll never cheapen her; 
fair, or I'll never look on her; mild, or come not  
near me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good 
discourse, an excellent musician, and her hair shall 
be of what colour it please God. Ha! the prince and 
Monsieur Love! I will hide me in the arbour.
