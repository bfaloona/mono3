love; with your hat penthouse-like o'er the shop of

'By heaven, that thou art fair, is most infallible;
      true, that thou art beauteous; truth itself, that
      thou art lovely. More fairer than fair, beautiful
      than beauteous, truer than truth itself, have
      commiseration on thy heroical vassal! The
      magnanimous and most illustrate king Cophetua set
      eye upon the pernicious and indubitate beggar 
      Zenelophon; and he it was that might rightly say,
      Veni, vidi, vici; which to annothanize in the
      vulgar,--O base and obscure vulgar!--videlicet, He
      came, saw, and overcame: he came, one; saw two;
      overcame, three. Who came? the king: why did he 
      come? to see: why did he see? to overcome: to
      whom came he? to the beggar: what saw he? the
      beggar: who overcame he? the beggar. The
      conclusion is victory: on whose side? the king's.
      The captive is enriched: on whose side? the 
      beggar's. The catastrophe is a nuptial: on whose
      side? the king's: no, on both in one, or one in
      both. I am the king; for so stands the comparison:
      thou the beggar; for so witnesseth thy lowliness.
      Shall I command thy love? I may: shall I enforce 
      thy love? I could: shall I entreat thy love? I
      will. What shalt thou exchange for rags? robes;
      for tittles? titles; for thyself? me. Thus,
      expecting thy reply, I profane my lips on thy foot,
      my eyes on thy picture. and my heart on thy every 
      part. Thine, in the dearest design of industry,
      DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO.'
      Thus dost thou hear the Nemean lion roar
      'Gainst thee, thou lamb, that standest as his prey.
      Submissive fall his princely feet before, 
      And he from forage will incline to play:
      But if thou strive, poor soul, what art thou then?
      Food for his rage, repasture for his den.

Do but behold the tears that swell in me,<br>

But do not love thyself; then thou wilt keep<br>
My tears for glasses, and still make me weep.<br>
O queen of queens! how far dost thou excel, <br>

That the lover, sick to death,<br>
Wish himself the heaven's breath.<br>
Air, quoth he, thy cheeks may blow;<br>
Air, would I might triumph so!<br>
But, alack, my hand is sworn <br>
Ne'er to pluck thee from thy thorn;<br>
Vow, alack, for youth unmeet,<br>
Youth so apt to pluck a sweet!<br>
Do not call it sin in me,<br>
That I am forsworn for thee; <br>
Thou for whom Jove would swear<br>
Juno but an Ethiope were;<br>
And deny himself for Jove,<br>
Turning mortal for thy love.<br>
This will I send, and something else more plain,<br>
That shall express my true love's fasting pain.<br>
O, would the king, Biron, and Longaville,<br>
Were lovers too! Ill, to example ill,<br>
Would from my forehead wipe a perjured note;<br>
For none offend where all alike do dote.

<i>[Advancing]</i><br>
Ah, good my liege, I pray thee, pardon me!<br>
Good heart, what grace hast thou, thus to reprove<br>
These worms for loving, that art most in love? <br>
Your eyes do make no coaches; in your tears<br>
There is no certain princess that appears;<br>
You'll not be perjured, 'tis a hateful thing;<br>
Tush, none but minstrels like of sonneting!<br>
But are you not ashamed? nay, are you not, <br>
All three of you, to be thus much o'ershot?<br>
You found his mote; the king your mote did see;<br>
But I a beam do find in each of three.<br>
O, what a scene of foolery have I seen,<br>
Of sighs, of groans, of sorrow and of teen! <br>
O me, with what strict patience have I sat,<br>
To see a king transformed to a gnat!<br>
To see great Hercules whipping a gig,<br>
And profound Solomon to tune a jig,<br>
And Nestor play at push-pin with the boys, <br>
And critic Timon laugh at idle toys!<br>
Where lies thy grief, O, tell me, good Dumain?<br>
And gentle Longaville, where lies thy pain?<br>
And where my liege's? all about the breast:<br>
A caudle, ho!

          <b>Biron.</b> Sweet lords, sweet lovers, O, let us embrace!<br>
      As true we are as flesh and blood can be:<br>
      The sea will ebb and flow, heaven show his face;<br>
      Young blood doth not obey an old decree:<br>
      We cannot cross the cause why we were born;<br>
      Therefore of all hands must we be forsworn. <br><br>

<del> <b>Ferdinand.</b> What, did these rent lines show some love of thine?</del><br><br>

<b>Biron.</b><br> Did they, quoth you? Who sees the heavenly Rosaline, <br>
      That, like a rude and savage man of Inde,<br>
      At the first opening of the gorgeous east,<br>
      Bows not his vassal head and strucken blind<br>
      Kisses the base ground with obedient breast?<br>
      What peremptory eagle-sighted eye <br>
      Dares look upon the heaven of her brow,<br>
      That is not blinded by her majesty? <br><br>

<del><b>Ferdinand.</b> What zeal, what fury hath inspired thee now?<br>
      My love, her mistress, is a gracious moon;<br>
      She an attending star, scarce seen a light. </del><br><br>

<b>Biron.</b> My eyes are then no eyes, nor I Biron:<br>
      O, but for my love, day would turn to night!<br>
      Of all complexions the cull'd sovereignty<br>
      Do meet, as at a fair, in her fair cheek,<br>
      Where several worthies make one dignity, <br>
      Where nothing wants that want itself doth seek.<br>
      Lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues,--<br>
      Fie, painted rhetoric! O, she needs it not:<br>
      To things of sale a seller's praise belongs,<br>
      She passes praise; then praise too short doth blot.<br>
      A wither'd hermit, five-score winters worn,<br>
      Might shake off fifty, looking in her eye:<br>
      Beauty doth varnish age, as if new-born,<br>
      And gives the crutch the cradle's infancy:<br>
      O, 'tis the sun that maketh all things shine. <br><br>

<del><b>Ferdinand.</b> By heaven, thy love is black as ebony. </del><br><br>

<b>Biron.</b> Is ebony like her? O wood divine!<br>
      A wife of such wood were felicity.<br>
      O, who can give an oath? where is a book?<br>
      That I may swear beauty doth beauty lack, <br>
      If that she learn not of her eye to look:<br>
      No face is fair that is not full so black. <br><br>

<del><b>Ferdinand.</b> O paradox! Black is the badge of hell,<br>
      The hue of dungeons and the suit of night;<br>
      And beauty's crest becomes the heavens well.</del><br><br>

<b>Biron.</b> Devils soonest tempt, resembling spirits of light.<br>
      O, if in black my lady's brows be deck'd,<br>
      It mourns that painting and usurping hair<br>
      Should ravish doters with a false aspect;<br>
      And therefore is she born to make black fair. <br>
      Her favour turns the fashion of the days,<br>
      For native blood is counted painting now;<br>
      And therefore red, that would avoid dispraise,<br>
      Paints itself black, to imitate her brow.

          <div align='right'>'Tis more than need.</div>
Have at you, then, affection's men at arms.<br>
Consider what you first did swear unto,<br>
To fast, to study, and to see no woman;<br>
Flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth.<br>
Say, can you fast? your stomachs are too young;<br>
And abstinence engenders maladies. <br>
And where that you have vow'd to study, lords,<br>
In that each of you have forsworn his book,<br>
Can you still dream and pore and thereon look?<br>
For when would you, my lord, or you, or you,<br>
Have found the ground of study's excellence <br>
Without the beauty of a woman's face?<br>
From women's eyes this doctrine I derive;<br>
They are the ground, the books, the academes<br>
From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire<br>
Why, universal plodding poisons up <br>
The nimble spirits in the arteries,<br>
As motion and long-during action tires<br>
The sinewy vigour of the traveller.<br>
Now, for not looking on a woman's face,<br>
You have in that forsworn the use of eyes <br>
And study too, the causer of your vow;<br>
For where is any author in the world<br>
Teaches such beauty as a woman's eye?<br>
Learning is but an adjunct to ourself<br>
And where we are our learning likewise is:<br>
Then when ourselves we see in ladies' eyes,<br>
Do we not likewise see our learning there?<br>
O, we have made a vow to study, lords,<br>
And in that vow we have forsworn our books.<br>
For when would you, my liege, or you, or you,<br>
In leaden contemplation have found out<br>
Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes<br>
Of beauty's tutors have enrich'd you with?<br>
Other slow arts entirely keep the brain;<br>
And therefore, finding barren practisers, <br>
Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil:<br>
But love, first learned in a lady's eyes,<br>
Lives not alone immured in the brain;<br>
But, with the motion of all elements,<br>
Courses as swift as thought in every power,<br>
And gives to every power a double power,<br>
Above their functions and their offices.<br>
It adds a precious seeing to the eye;<br>
A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind;<br>
A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound,<br>
When the suspicious head of theft is stopp'd:<br>
Love's feeling is more soft and sensible<br>
Than are the tender horns of cockl'd snails;<br>
Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:<br>
For valour, is not Love a Hercules, <br>
Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?<br>
Subtle as Sphinx; as sweet and musical<br>
As bright Apollo's lute, strung with his hair:<br>
And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods<br>
Makes heaven drowsy with the harmony. <br>
Never durst poet touch a pen to write<br>
Until his ink were temper'd with Love's sighs;<br>
O, then his lines would ravish savage ears<br>
And plant in tyrants mild humility.<br>
From women's eyes this doctrine I derive: <br>
They sparkle still the right Promethean fire;<br>
They are the books, the arts, the academes,<br>
That show, contain and nourish all the world:<br>
Else none at all in ought proves excellent.<br>
Then fools you were these women to forswear, <br>
Or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.<br>
For wisdom's sake, a word that all men love,<br>
Or for love's sake, a word that loves all men,<br>
Or for men's sake, the authors of these women,<br>
Or women's sake, by whom we men are men, <br>
Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves,<br>
Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths.<br>
It is religion to be thus forsworn,<br>
For charity itself fulfills the law,<br>
And who can sever love from charity?

fable: some certain special honours it pleaseth his
greatness to impart to Armado, a soldier, a man of
travel, that hath seen the world; but let that pass. 
The very all of all is,--but, sweet heart, I do
implore secrecy,--that the king would have me
present the princess, sweet chuck, with some
delightful ostentation, or show, or pageant, or
antique, or firework. Now, understanding that the 
curate and your sweet self are good at such

When, lo! to interrupt my purposed rest, <br>
Toward that shade I might behold addrest<br>
The king and his companions: warily<br>
I stole into a neighbour thicket by,<br>
And overheard what you shall overhear,<br>
That, by and by, disguised they will be here.<br>
Their herald is a pretty knavish page,<br>
That well by heart hath conn'd his embassage:<br>
Action and accent did they teach him there;<br>
'Thus must thou speak,' and 'thus thy body bear:'<br>
And ever and anon they made a doubt <br>
Presence majestical would put him out,<br>
'For,' quoth the king, 'an angel shalt thou see;<br>
Yet fear not thou, but speak audaciously.'<br>
The boy replied, 'An angel is not evil;<br>
I should have fear'd her had she been a devil.' <br>
With that, all laugh'd and clapp'd him on the shoulder,<br>
Making the bold wag by their praises bolder:<br>
One rubb'd his elbow thus, and fleer'd and swore<br>
A better speech was never spoke before;<br>
Another, with his finger and his thumb, <br>
Cried, 'Via! we will do't, come what will come;'<br>
The third he caper'd, and cried, 'All goes well;'<br>
The fourth turn'd on the toe, and down he fell.<br>
With that, they all did tumble on the ground,<br>
With such a zealous laughter, so profound, <br>
That in this spleen ridiculous appears,<br>
To cheque their folly, passion's solemn tears.

          Neither of either; I remit both twain.<br>
I see the trick on't: here was a consent,<br>
Knowing aforehand of our merriment,<br>
To dash it like a Christmas comedy:<br>
Some carry-tale, some please-man, some slight zany,<br>
Some mumble-news, some trencher-knight, some Dick,<br>
That smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick<br>
To make my lady laugh when she's disposed,<br>
Told our intents before; which once disclosed,<br>
The ladies did change favours: and then we, <br>
Following the signs, woo'd but the sign of she.<br>
Now, to our perjury to add more terror,<br>
We are again forsworn, in will and error.<br>
Much upon this it is: and might not you<br>
<i>[To BOYET]</i><br>
Forestall our sport, to make us thus untrue?<br>
Do not you know my lady's foot by the squier,<br>
And laugh upon the apple of her eye?<br>
And stand between her back, sir, and the fire,<br>
Holding a trencher, jesting merrily? <br>
You put our page out: go, you are allow'd;<br>
Die when you will, a smock shall be your shroud.<br>
You leer upon me, do you? there's an eye<br>
Wounds like a leaden sword.

          Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief;<br>
And by these badges understand the king.<br>
For your fair sakes have we neglected time, <br>
Play'd foul play with our oaths: your beauty, ladies,<br>
Hath much deform'd us, fashioning our humours<br>
Even to the opposed end of our intents:<br>
And what in us hath seem'd ridiculous,--<br>
As love is full of unbefitting strains, <br>
All wanton as a child, skipping and vain,<br>
Form'd by the eye and therefore, like the eye,<br>
Full of strange shapes, of habits and of forms,<br>
Varying in subjects as the eye doth roll<br>
To every varied object in his glance: <br>
Which parti-coated presence of loose love<br>
Put on by us, if, in your heavenly eyes,<br>
Have misbecomed our oaths and gravities,<br>
Those heavenly eyes, that look into these faults,<br>
Suggested us to make. Therefore, ladies, <br>
Our love being yours, the error that love makes<br>
Is likewise yours: we to ourselves prove false,<br>
By being once false for ever to be true<br>
To those that make us both,--fair ladies, you:<br>
And even that falsehood, in itself a sin,<br>
Thus purifies itself and turns to grace.

So much, dear liege, I have already sworn,<br>
That is, to live and study here three years.<br>

The which I hope is not enrolled there;<br>

And then, to sleep but three hours in the night,<br>
And not be seen to wink of all the day.<br>
When I was wont to think no harm all night<br>
And make a dark night too of half the day.<br>
Which I hope well is not enrolled there:<br>
O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,<br>
Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!<br>
