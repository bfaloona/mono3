 Since fate, against thy better disposition, <br>
 Hath made thy person for the thrower-out<br>
 Of my poor babe, according to thine oath,<br>
 Places remote enough are in Bohemia,<br>
 There weep and leave it crying; and, for the babe<br>
 Is counted lost for ever, Perdita, <br>
 I prithee, call't. For this ungentle business<br>
 Put on thee by my lord, thou ne'er shalt see<br>
 Thy wife Paulina more.' And so, with shrieks<br>
 She melted into air. Affrighted much,<br>
 I did in time collect myself and thought <br>
 This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys:<br>
 Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously,<br>
 I will be squared by this. I do believe<br>
 Hermione hath suffer'd death, and that<br>
 Apollo would, this being indeed the issue <br>
 Of King Polixenes, it should here be laid,<br>
 Either for life or death, upon the earth<br>
 Of its right father. Blossom, speed thee well!<br>
 There lie, and there thy character: there these;<br>
 Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty, <br>
 And still rest thine. The storm begins; poor wretch,<br>
 That for thy mother's fault art thus exposed<br>
 To loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot,<br>
 But my heart bleeds; and most accursed am I<br>
 To be by oath enjoin'd to this. Farewell! <br>
 The day frowns more and more: thou'rt like to have<br>
 A lullaby too rough: I never saw<br>
 The heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!<br>
 Well may I get aboard! This is the chase:<br>
 I am gone for ever. <br>

all my trumpery; not a counterfeit stone, not a
ribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table-book, ballad,
knife, tape, glove, shoe-tie, bracelet, horn-ring, 
to keep my pack from fasting: they throng who
should buy first, as if my trinkets had been
hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer:
by which means I saw whose purse was best in
picture; and what I saw, to my good use I 2565
remembered. My clown, who wants but something to
be a reasonable man, grew so in love with the
wenches' song, that he would not stir his pettitoes
till he had both tune and words; which so drew the
rest of the herd to me that all their other senses 
stuck in ears: you might have pinched a placket, it
was senseless; 'twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a
purse; I could have filed keys off that hung in
chains: no hearing, no feeling, but my sir's song,
and admiring the nothing of it. So that in this 
time of lethargy I picked and cut most of their
festival purses; and had not the old man come in
with a whoo-bub against his daughter and the king's
son and scared my choughs from the chaff, I had not
left a purse alive in the whole army.
