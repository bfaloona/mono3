 Since fate, against thy better disposition, <br>
 Hath made thy person for the thrower-out<br>
 Of my poor babe, according to thine oath,<br>
 Places remote enough are in Bohemia,<br>
 There weep and leave it crying; and, for the babe<br>
 Is counted lost for ever, Perdita, <br>
 I prithee, call't. For this ungentle business<br>
 Put on thee by my lord, thou ne'er shalt see<br>
 Thy wife Paulina more.' And so, with shrieks<br>
 She melted into air. Affrighted much,<br>
 I did in time collect myself and thought <br>
 This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys:<br>
 Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously,<br>
 I will be squared by this. I do believe<br>
 Hermione hath suffer'd death, and that<br>
 Apollo would, this being indeed the issue <br>
 Of King Polixenes, it should here be laid,<br>
 Either for life or death, upon the earth<br>
 Of its right father. Blossom, speed thee well!<br>
 There lie, and there thy character: there these;<br>
 Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty, <br>
 And still rest thine. The storm begins; poor wretch,<br>
 That for thy mother's fault art thus exposed<br>
 To loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot,<br>
 But my heart bleeds; and most accursed am I<br>
 To be by oath enjoin'd to this. Farewell! <br>
 The day frowns more and more: thou'rt like to have<br>
 A lullaby too rough: I never saw<br>
 The heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!<br>
 Well may I get aboard! This is the chase:<br>
 I am gone for ever. <br>

all my trumpery; not a counterfeit stone, not a
ribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table-book, ballad,
knife, tape, glove, shoe-tie, bracelet, horn-ring, 
to keep my pack from fasting: they throng who
should buy first, as if my trinkets had been
hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer:
by which means I saw whose purse was best in
picture; and what I saw, to my good use I 2565
remembered. My clown, who wants but something to
be a reasonable man, grew so in love with the
wenches' song, that he would not stir his pettitoes
till he had both tune and words; which so drew the
rest of the herd to me that all their other senses 
stuck in ears: you might have pinched a placket, it
was senseless; 'twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a
purse; I could have filed keys off that hung in
chains: no hearing, no feeling, but my sir's song,
and admiring the nothing of it. So that in this 
time of lethargy I picked and cut most of their
festival purses; and had not the old man come in
with a whoo-bub against his daughter and the king's
son and scared my choughs from the chaff, I had not
left a purse alive in the whole army.

          Since what I am to say must be but that<br>
Which contradicts my accusation and <br>
The testimony on my part no other<br>
But what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me<br>
To say 'not guilty:' mine integrity<br>
Being counted falsehood, shall, as I express it,<br>
Be so received. But thus: if powers divine<br>
Behold our human actions, as they do,<br>
I doubt not then but innocence shall make<br>
False accusation blush and tyranny<br>
Tremble at patience. You, my lord, best know,<br>
Who least will seem to do so, my past life<br>
Hath been as continent, as chaste, as true,<br>
As I am now unhappy; which is more<br>
Than history can pattern, though devised<br>
And play'd to take spectators. For behold me<br>
A fellow of the royal bed, which owe <br>
A moiety of the throne a great king's daughter,<br>
The mother to a hopeful prince, here standing<br>
To prate and talk for life and honour 'fore<br>
Who please to come and hear. For life, I prize it<br>
As I weigh grief, which I would spare: for honour, <br>
'Tis a derivative from me to mine,<br>
And only that I stand for. I appeal<br>
To your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes<br>
Came to your court, how I was in your grace,<br>
How merited to be so; since he came, <br>
With what encounter so uncurrent I<br>
Have strain'd to appear thus: if one jot beyond<br>
The bound of honour, or in act or will<br>
That way inclining, harden'd be the hearts<br>
Of all that hear me, and my near'st of kin <br>
Cry fie upon my grave!

The bug which you would fright me with I seek.<br>
To me can life be no commodity: <br>
The crown and comfort of my life, your favour,<br>
I do give lost; for I do feel it gone,<br>
But know not how it went. My second joy<br>
And first-fruits of my body, from his presence<br>
I am barr'd, like one infectious. My third comfort <br>
Starr'd most unluckily, is from my breast,<br>
The innocent milk in its most innocent mouth,<br>
Haled out to murder: myself on every post<br>
Proclaimed a strumpet: with immodest hatred<br>
The child-bed privilege denied, which 'longs <br>
To women of all fashion; lastly, hurried<br>
Here to this place, i' the open air, before<br>
I have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,<br>
Tell me what blessings I have here alive,<br>
That I should fear to die? Therefore proceed.<br>
But yet hear this: mistake me not; no life,<br>
I prize it not a straw, but for mine honour,<br>
Which I would free, if I shall be condemn'd<br>
Upon surmises, all proofs sleeping else<br>
But what your jealousies awake, I tell you <br>
'Tis rigor and not law. Your honours all,<br>
I do refer me to the oracle:<br>
Apollo be my judge!

Must I receive, whose every word deserves<br>
To taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny<br>
Together working with thy jealousies, <br>
Fancies too weak for boys, too green and idle<br>
For girls of nine, O, think what they have done<br>
And then run mad indeed, stark mad! for all<br>
Thy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it.<br>
That thou betray'dst Polixenes,'twas nothing; <br>
That did but show thee, of a fool, inconstant<br>
And damnable ingrateful: nor was't much,<br>
Thou wouldst have poison'd good Camillo's honour,<br>
To have him kill a king: poor trespasses,<br>
More monstrous standing by: whereof I reckon <br>
The casting forth to crows thy baby-daughter<br>
To be or none or little; though a devil<br>
Would have shed water out of fire ere done't:<br>
Nor is't directly laid to thee, the death<br>
Of the young prince, whose honourable thoughts, <br>
Thoughts high for one so tender, cleft the heart<br>
That could conceive a gross and foolish sire<br>
Blemish'd his gracious dam: this is not, no,<br>
Laid to thy answer: but the last,—O lords,<br>
When I have said, cry 'woe!' the queen, the queen, <br>
The sweet'st, dear'st creature's dead,<br>
and vengeance for't<br>
Not dropp'd down yet.

O'er sixteen years and leave the growth untried<br>

To the freshest things now reigning and make stale <br>

Now seems to it. Your patience this allowing,<br>
I turn my glass and give my scene such growing<br>
As you had slept between: Leontes leaving,<br>
The effects of his fond jealousies so grieving <br>
That he shuts up himself, imagine me,<br>
Gentle spectators, that I now may be<br>
In fair Bohemia, and remember well,<br>
I mentioned a son o' the king's, which Florizel<br>
I now name to you; and with speed so pace <br>
To speak of Perdita, now grown in grace<br>
Equal with wondering: what of her ensues<br>
I list not prophecy; but let Time's news<br>
Be known when 'tis brought forth. A shepherd's daughter, <br>
And what to her adheres, which follows after,<br>
Is the argument of Time. Of this allow,<br>
If ever you have spent time worse ere now;<br>
If never, yet that Time himself doth say<br>
He wishes earnestly you never may.
