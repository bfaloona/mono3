          If to do were as easy as to know what were good to
do, chapels had been churches and poor men's
cottages princes' palaces. It is a good divine that
follows his own instructions: I can easier teach
twenty what were good to be done, than be one of the
twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may
devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps
o'er a cold decree: such a hare is madness the
youth, to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the
cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to
choose me a husband. O me, the word 'choose!' I may
neither choose whom I would nor refuse whom I
dislike; so is the will of a living daughter curbed
by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard,
Nerissa, that I cannot choose one nor refuse none?

          I pray you, tarry: pause a day or two<br>
Before you hazard; for, in choosing wrong,<br>
I lose your company: therefore forbear awhile.<br>
There's something tells me, but it is not love,<br>
I would not lose you; and you know yourself,<br>
Hate counsels not in such a quality.<br>
But lest you should not understand me well,--<br>
And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought,--<br>
I would detain you here some month or two<br>
Before you venture for me. I could teach you<br>
How to choose right, but I am then forsworn;<br>
So will I never be: so may you miss me; <br>
But if you do, you'll make me wish a sin,<br>
That I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes,<br>
They have o'erlook'd me and divided me;<br>
One half of me is yours, the other half yours,<br>
Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours, <br>
And so all yours. O, these naughty times<br>
Put bars between the owners and their rights!<br>
And so, though yours, not yours. Prove it so,<br>
Let fortune go to hell for it, not I.<br>
I speak too long; but 'tis to peize the time,<br>
To eke it and to draw it out in length,<br>
To stay you from election. <br>

          Away, then! I am lock'd in one of them:<br>
If you do love me, you will find me out.<br>
Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof.<br>
Let music sound while he doth make his choice;<br>
Then, if he lose, he makes a swan-like end,<br>
Fading in music: that the comparison<br>
May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream<br>
And watery death-bed for him. He may win;<br>
And what is music then? Then music is<br>
Even as the flourish when true subjects bow<br>
To a new-crowned monarch: such it is<br>
As are those dulcet sounds in break of day<br>
That creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear,<br>
And summon him to marriage. Now he goes,<br>
With no less presence, but with much more love,<br>
Than young Alcides, when he did redeem<br>
The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy<br>
To the sea-monster: I stand for sacrifice<br>
The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives,<br>
With bleared visages, come forth to view<br>
The issue of the exploit. Go, Hercules!<br>
Live thou, I live: with much, much more dismay<br>
I view the fight than thou that makest the fray.<br>
<i>[Music, whilst BASSANIO comments on the caskets to himself]</i>
SONG.<br>
Tell me where is fancy bred,<br>
Or in the heart, or in the head?<br>
How begot, how nourished?<br>
Reply, reply.<br>
It is engender'd in the eyes,<br>
With gazing fed; and fancy dies<br>
In the cradle where it lies.<br>
Let us all ring fancy's knell<br>
I'll begin it,.Ding, dong, bell. <br>

She is not bred so dull but she can learn;<br>
Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit<br>

Of this fair mansion, master of my servants,<br>
Queen o'er myself: and even now, but now,<br>
This house, these servants and this same myself<br>
Are yours, my lord: I give them with this ring;<br>

But mercy is above this sceptred sway;<br>
It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,<br>
It is an attribute to God himself;<br>
And earthly power doth then show likest God's<br>
When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,<br>
Though justice be thy plea, consider this,<br>
That, in the course of justice, none of us<br>
Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;<br>
And that same prayer doth teach us all to render<br>
The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much<br>
To mitigate the justice of thy plea;<br>
Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice<br>
Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there. <br>
