What harm a wind too great at sea might do.<br>
I should not see the sandy hour-glass run,<br>

And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand,<br>
Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs <br>
To kiss her burial. Should I go to church<br>
And see the holy edifice of stone,<br>
And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,<br>
Which touching but my gentle vessel's side,<br>
Would scatter all her spices on the stream,<br>
Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,<br>
And, in a word, but even now worth this,<br>
And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought<br>
To think on this, and shall I lack the thought<br>
That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?<br>
But tell not me; I know, Antonio<br>
Is sad to think upon his merchandise.<br>

          Let me play the fool:<br>
With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,<br>
And let my liver rather heat with wine<br>
Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.<br>
Why should a man, whose blood is warm within,<br>
Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster? <br>
Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice<br>
By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio.<br>
I love thee, and it is my love that speaks.<br>
There are a sort of men whose visages<br>
Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,<br>
And do a wilful stillness entertain,<br>
With purpose to be dress'd in an opinion<br>
Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,<br>
As who should say 'I am Sir Oracle,<br>
And when I ope my lips let no dog bark!'<br>
O my Antonio, I do know of these<br>
That therefore only are reputed wise<br>
For saying nothing; when, I am very sure,<br>
If they should speak, would almost damn those ears,<br>
Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.<br>
I'll tell thee more of this another time:<br>
But fish not, with this melancholy bait,<br>
For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.<br>
Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well awhile:<br>
I'll end my exhortation after dinner.

      How much I have disabled mine estate, <br>
      By something showing a more swelling port<br>
      Than my faint means would grant continuance:<br>
      Nor do I now make moan to be abridged<br>
      From such a noble rate; but my chief care<br>
      Is to come fairly off from the great debts<br>
      Wherein my time something too prodigal<br>
      Hath left me gaged. To you, Antonio,<br>
      I owe the most, in money and in love,<br>
      And from your love I have a warranty<br>
      To unburden all my plots and purposes<br>
      How to get clear of all the debts I owe. <br><br>

   <del> <b>Antonio.</b> I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;<br>
      And if it stand, as you yourself still do,<br>
      Within the eye of honour, be assured,<br>
      My purse, my person, my extremest means, <br>
      Lie all unlock'd to your occasions. </del><br><br>

 <b>Bassanio.</b> In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,<br>
      I shot his fellow of the self-same flight<br>
      The self-same way with more advised watch,<br>
      To find the other forth, and by adventuring both<br>
      I oft found both: I urge this childhood proof,<br>
      Because what follows is pure innocence.<br>
      I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,<br>
      That which I owe is lost; but if you please<br>
      To shoot another arrow that self way <br>
      Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,<br>
      As I will watch the aim, or to find both<br>
      Or bring your latter hazard back again<br>
      And thankfully rest debtor for the first. <br><br>

<del>    <b>Antonio.</b> You know me well, and herein spend but time<br>
      To wind about my love with circumstance;<br>
      And out of doubt you do me now more wrong<br>
      In making question of my uttermost<br>
      Than if you had made waste of all I have:<br>
      Then do but say to me what I should do <br>
      That in your knowledge may by me be done,<br>
      And I am prest unto it: therefore, speak. </del><br><br>

    <b>Bassanio.</b> In Belmont is a lady richly left;<br>
      And she is fair, and, fairer than that word,<br>
      Of wondrous virtues: sometimes from her eyes <br>
      I did receive fair speechless messages:<br>
      Her name is Portia, nothing undervalued<br>
      To Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia:<br>
      Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,<br>
      For the four winds blow in from every coast <br>
      Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks<br>
      Hang on her temples like a golden fleece;<br>
      Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos' strand,<br>
      And many Jasons come in quest of her.<br>
      O my Antonio, had I but the means <br>
      To hold a rival place with one of them,<br>
      I have a mind presages me such thrift,<br>
      That I should questionless be fortunate!

man's son,' or rather an honest woman's son; for, 
indeed, my father did something smack, something
grow to, he had a kind of taste; well, my conscience

fiend. 'Budge not,' says my conscience.
'Conscience,' say I, 'you counsel well;' ' Fiend,' 
say I, 'you counsel well:' to be ruled by my
conscience, I should stay with the Jew my master,
who, God bless the mark, is a kind of devil; and, to
run away from the Jew, I should be ruled by the
fiend, who, saving your reverence, is the devil 
himself. Certainly the Jew is the very devil
incarnal; and, in my conscience, my conscience is
but a kind of hard conscience, to offer to counsel
me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more
friendly counsel: I will run, fiend; my heels are 
at your command; I will run.

What says this leaden casket?<br>
'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'<br>
Must give: for what? for lead? hazard for lead?<br>
This casket threatens. Men that hazard all<br>
Do it in hope of fair advantages: <br>
A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross;<br>
I'll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.<br>
What says the silver with her virgin hue?<br>
'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'<br>
As much as he deserves! Pause there, Morocco, <br>
And weigh thy value with an even hand:<br>
If thou be'st rated by thy estimation,<br>
Thou dost deserve enough; and yet enough<br>
May not extend so far as to the lady:<br>
And yet to be afeard of my deserving<br>
Were but a weak disabling of myself.<br>
As much as I deserve! Why, that's the lady:<br>
I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes,<br>
In graces and in qualities of breeding;<br>
But more than these, in love I do deserve.<br>
What if I stray'd no further, but chose here?<br>
Let's see once more this saying graved in gold<br>
'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'<br>
Why, that's the lady; all the world desires her;<br>
From the four corners of the earth they come,<br>
To kiss this shrine, this mortal-breathing saint:<br>
The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds<br>
Of wide Arabia are as thoroughfares now<br>
For princes to come view fair Portia:<br>
The watery kingdom, whose ambitious head<br>
Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar<br>
To stop the foreign spirits, but they come,<br>
As o'er a brook, to see fair Portia.<br>
One of these three contains her heavenly picture.<br>
Is't like that lead contains her? 'Twere damnation<br>
To think so base a thought: it were too gross<br>
To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.<br>
Or shall I think in silver she's immured,<br>
Being ten times undervalued to tried gold?<br>
O sinful thought! Never so rich a gem<br>
Was set in worse than gold. They have in England<br>
A coin that bears the figure of an angel<br>
Stamped in gold, but that's insculp'd upon;<br>
But here an angel in a golden bed<br>
Lies all within. Deliver me the key: <br>
Here do I choose, and thrive I as I may!

      Were purchased by the merit of the wearer!<br>
      How many then should cover that stand bare!<br>
      How many be commanded that command!<br>
      How much low peasantry would then be glean'd <br>
      From the true seed of honour! and how much honour<br>
      Pick'd from the chaff and ruin of the times<br>
      To be new-varnish'd! Well, but to my choice:<br>
      'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'<br>

revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will

what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian
wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by

That ever blotted paper! Gentle lady,<br>
When I did first impart my love to you,<br>
I freely told you, all the wealth I had<br>
Ran in my veins, I was a gentleman;<br>
And then I told you true: and yet, dear lady,<br>
Rating myself at nothing, you shall see<br>
How much I was a braggart. When I told you<br>
My state was nothing, I should then have told you <br>
That I was worse than nothing; for, indeed,<br>
I have engaged myself to a dear friend,<br>
Engaged my friend to his mere enemy,<br>
To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady;<br>
The paper as the body of my friend, <br>
And every word in it a gaping wound,<br>
Issuing life-blood. But is it true, Salerio?<br>
Have all his ventures fail'd? What, not one hit?<br>
From Tripolis, from Mexico and England,<br>
From Lisbon, Barbary and India? <br>
And not one vessel 'scape the dreadful touch<br>
Of merchant-marring rocks?

          But little: I am arm'd and well prepared.<br>
Give me your hand, Bassanio: fare you well! <br>
Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you;<br>
For herein Fortune shows herself more kind<br>
Than is her custom: it is still her use<br>
To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,<br>
To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow<br>
An age of poverty; from which lingering penance<br>
Of such misery doth she cut me off.<br>
Commend me to your honourable wife:<br>
Tell her the process of Antonio's end;<br>
Say how I loved you, speak me fair in death; <br>
And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge<br>
Whether Bassanio had not once a love.<br>
Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,<br>
And he repents not that he pays your debt;<br>
For if the Jew do cut but deep enough,<br>
I'll pay it presently with all my heart.

Sweet soul, let's in, and there expect their coming.<br>
      And yet no matter: why should we go in?<br>
      My friend Stephano, signify, I pray you,<br>
      Within the house, your mistress is at hand; <br>
      And bring your music forth into the air.<br>
      <i>[Exit Stephano]</i><br>
      How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!<br>
      Here will we sit and let the sounds of music<br>
      Creep in our ears: soft stillness and the night <br>
      Become the touches of sweet harmony.<br>
      Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven<br>
      Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold:<br>
      There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st<br>
      But in his motion like an angel sings, <br>
      Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins;<br>
      Such harmony is in immortal souls;<br>
      But whilst this muddy vesture of decay<br>
      Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.<br>
      <i>[Enter Musicians]</i><br>
      Come, ho! and wake Diana with a hymn!<br>
      With sweetest touches pierce your mistress' ear,<br>
      And draw her home with music. <br><br>

<i>[Music]</i><br><br>

<del><b>Jessica.</b> I am never merry when I hear sweet music.</del><br><br>

<b>Lorenzo.</b> 
The reason is, your spirits are attentive:<br>
      For do but note a wild and wanton herd,<br>
      Or race of youthful and unhandled colts,<br>
      Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,<br>
      Which is the hot condition of their blood; <br>
      If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,<br>
      Or any air of music touch their ears,<br>
      You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,<br>
      Their savage eyes turn'd to a modest gaze<br>
      By the sweet power of music: therefore the poet<br>
      Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones and floods;<br>
      Since nought so stockish, hard and full of rage,<br>
      But music for the time doth change his nature.<br>
      The man that hath no music in himself,<br>
      Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,<br>
      Is fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils;<br>
      The motions of his spirit are dull as night<br>
      And his affections dark as Erebus:<br>
      Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.

Sweet Portia,

<div align=right>Sweet Portia,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
      If you did know to whom I gave the ring,<br>
      If you did know for whom I gave the ring<br>
      And would conceive for what I gave the ring<br>
      And how unwillingly I left the ring,<br>
      When nought would be accepted but the ring,<br>
      You would abate the strength of your displeasure.<br><br> 

    <del><b>Portia.</b> If you had known the virtue of the ring,<br>
      Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,<br>
      Or your own honour to contain the ring,<br>
      You would not then have parted with the ring.<br>
      What man is there so much unreasonable,<br>
      If you had pleased to have defended it<br>
      With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty<br>
      To urge the thing held as a ceremony?<br>
      Nerissa teaches me what to believe: <br>
      I'll die for't but some woman had the ring.</del><br><br> 

    <b>Bassanio.</b> <br>
      No, by my honour, madam, by my soul,<br>
      No woman had it, but a civil doctor,<br>
      Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me<br>
      And begg'd the ring; the which I did deny him <br>
      And suffer'd him to go displeased away;<br>
      Even he that did uphold the very life<br>
      Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady?<br>
      I was enforced to send it after him;<br>
      I was beset with shame and courtesy;<br>
      My honour would not let ingratitude<br>
      So much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady;<br>
      For, by these blessed candles of the night,<br>
      Had you been there, I think you would have begg'd<br>
      The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.
