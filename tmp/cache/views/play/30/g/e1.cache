          <b> Menenius Agrippa.</b> I tell you, friends, most charitable care<br>
 Have the patricians of you. For your wants,<br>
 Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well<br>
 Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them<br>
 Against the Roman state, whose course will on<br>
 The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs<br>
 Of more strong link asunder than can ever<br>
 Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,<br>
 The gods, not the patricians, make it, and<br>
 Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,<br>
 You are transported by calamity<br>
 Thither where more attends you, and you slander<br>
 The helms o' the state, who care for you like fathers,<br>
 When you curse them as enemies. <br>
<br>
<del><b>First Citizen.</b> Care for us! True, indeed! They ne'er cared for us<br>
 yet: suffer us to famish, and their store-houses<br>
 crammed with grain; make edicts for usury, to<br>
 support usurers; repeal daily any wholesome act<br>
 established against the rich, and provide more <br>
 piercing statutes daily, to chain up and restrain<br>
 the poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will; and<br>
 there's all the love they bear us.</del> <br>
<br>
<b>Menenius Agrippa.</b> Either you must<br>
 Confess yourselves wondrous malicious, <br>
 Or be accused of folly. I shall tell you<br>
 A pretty tale: it may be you have heard it;<br>
 But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture<br>
 To stale 't a little more. <br>
<br>
<del><b>First Citizen.</b> Well, I'll hear it, sir: yet you must not think to <br>
 fob off our disgrace with a tale: but, an 't please<br>
 you, deliver. </del><br>
<br>
<b>Menenius Agrippa.</b> There was a time when all the body's members<br>
 Rebell'd against the belly, thus accused it:<br>
 That only like a gulf it did remain <br>
 I' the midst o' the body, idle and unactive,<br>
 Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing<br>
 Like labour with the rest, where the other instruments<br>
 Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,<br>
 And, mutually participate, did minister <br>
 Unto the appetite and affection common<br>
 Of the whole body. The belly answer'dâ€” <br>
<br>
<del><b>First Citizen.</b> Well, sir, what answer made the belly? </del><br>
<br>
<b>Menenius Agrippa.</b> Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,<br>
 Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thusâ€” <br>
 For, look you, I may make the belly smile<br>
 As well as speakâ€”it tauntingly replied<br>
 To the discontented members, the mutinous parts<br>
 That envied his receipt; even so most fitly<br>
 As you malign our senators for that <br>
 They are not such as you.

 At home, upon my brother's guard, even there,<br>

          <b>Menenius Agrippa.</b> I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that<br>
 loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying<br>
 Tiber in't; said to be something imperfect in<br>
 favouring the first complaint; hasty and tinder-like<br>
 upon too trivial motion; one that converses more <br>
 with the buttock of the night than with the forehead<br>
 of the morning: what I think I utter, and spend my<br>
 malice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen as<br>
 you areâ€”I cannot call you Lycurgusesâ€”if the drink<br>
 you give me touch my palate adversely, I make a <br>
 crooked face at it. I can't say your worships have<br>
 delivered the matter well, when I find the ass in<br>
 compound with the major part of your syllables: and<br>
 though I must be content to bear with those that say<br>
 you are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that <br>
 tell you you have good faces. If you see this in<br>
 the map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known<br>
 well enough too? what barm can your bisson<br>
 conspectuities glean out of this character, if I be<br>
 known well enough too? <br>
<br>
<del><b>Junius Brutus.</b> Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.</del> <br>
<br>
<b>Menenius Agrippa.</b> You know neither me, yourselves nor any thing. You<br>
 are ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs: you<br>
 wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a<br>
 cause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller; <br>
 and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a<br>
 second day of audience. When you are hearing a<br>
 matter between party and party, if you chance to be<br>
 pinched with the colic, you make faces like<br>
 mummers; set up the bloody flag against all <br>
 patience; and, in roaring for a chamber-pot,<br>
 dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled<br>
 by your hearing: all the peace you make in their<br>
 cause is, calling both the parties knaves. You are<br>
 a pair of strange ones. <br>
<br>
<del><b>Junius Brutus.</b> Come, come, you are well understood to be a<br>
 perfecter giber for the table than a necessary<br>
 bencher in the Capitol. </del><br>
<br>
<b>Menenius Agrippa.</b> Our very priests must become mockers, if they shall<br>
 encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When <br>
 you speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth the<br>
 wagging of your beards; and your beards deserve not<br>
 so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's<br>
 cushion, or to be entombed in an ass's pack-<br>
 saddle. Yet you must be saying, CORIOLANUS is proud;<br>
 who in a cheap estimation, is worth predecessors<br>
 since Deucalion, though peradventure some of the<br>
 best of 'em were hereditary hangmen. God-den to<br>
 your worships: more of your conversation would<br>
 infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly <br>
 plebeians: I will be bold to take my leave of you.

Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held<br>
That valour is the chiefest virtue, and<br>
Most dignifies the haver: if it be,<br>
The man I speak of cannot in the world<br>
Be singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,<br>
When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought <br>
Beyond the mark of others: our then dictator,<br>
Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight,<br>
When with his Amazonian chin he drove<br>
The bristled lips before him: be bestrid<br>
An o'er-press'd Roman and i' the consul's view<br>
Slew three opposers: Tarquin's self he met,<br>
And struck him on his knee: in that day's feats,<br>
When he might act the woman in the scene,<br>
He proved best man i' the field, and for his meed<br>
Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age <br>
Man-enter'd thus, he waxed like a sea,<br>
And in the brunt of seventeen battles since<br>
He lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last,<br>
Before and in Corioli, let me say,<br>
I cannot speak him home: he stopp'd the fliers; <br>
And by his rare example made the coward<br>
Turn terror into sport: as weeds before<br>
A vessel under sail, so men obey'd<br>
And fell below his stem: his sword, death's stamp,<br>
Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot <br>
He was a thing of blood, whose every motion<br>
Was timed with dying cries: alone he enter'd<br>
The mortal gate of the city, which he painted<br>
With shunless destiny; aidless came off,<br>
And with a sudden reinforcement struck <br>
Corioli like a planet: now all's his:<br>
When, by and by, the din of war gan pierce<br>
His ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit<br>
Re-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate,<br>
And to the battle came he; where he did<br>
Run reeking o'er the lives of men, as if<br>
'Twere a perpetual spoil: and till we call'd<br>
Both field and city ours, he never stood<br>
To ease his breast with panting.

You grave but reckless senators, have you thus<br>
Given Hydra here to choose an officer,<br>
That with his peremptory 'shall,' being but<br>
The horn and noise o' the monster's, wants not spirit<br>
To say he'll turn your current in a ditch,<br>
And make your channel his? If he have power<br>
Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake<br>
Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,<br>
Be not as common fools; if you are not, <br>
Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,<br>
If they be senators: and they are no less,<br>
When, both your voices blended, the great'st taste<br>
Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,<br>
And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,' <br>
His popular 'shall' against a graver bench<br>
Than ever frown in Greece. By Jove himself!<br>
It makes the consuls base: and my soul aches<br>
To know, when two authorities are up,<br>
Neither supreme, how soon confusion <br>
May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take<br>
The one by the other.

 More worthier than their voices. They know the corn<br>
 Was not our recompense, resting well assured <br>
 That ne'er did service for't: being press'd to the war,<br>
 Even when the navel of the state was touch'd,<br>
 They would not thread the gates. This kind of service<br>
 Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i' the war<br>
 Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd <br>
 Most valour, spoke not for them: the accusation<br>
 Which they have often made against the senate,<br>
 All cause unborn, could never be the motive<br>
 Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?<br>
 How shall this bisson multitude digest <br>
 The senate's courtesy? Let deeds express<br>
 What's like to be their words: 'we did request it;<br>
 We are the greater poll, and in true fear<br>
 They gave us our demands.' Thus we debase<br>
 The nature of our seats and make the rabble <br>
 Call our cares fears; which will in time<br>
 Break ope the locks o' the senate and bring in<br>
 The crows to peck the eagles. <br>

 Seal what I end withal! This double worship,<br>
 Where one part does disdain with cause, the other<br>
 Insult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom, <br>
 Cannot conclude but by the yea and no<br>
 Of general ignorance,â€”it must omit<br>
 Real necessities, and give way the while<br>
 To unstable slightness: purpose so barr'd, it follows, <br>
 Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you,â€”<br>
 You that will be less fearful than discreet,<br>
 That love the fundamental part of state<br>
 More than you doubt the change on't, that prefer<br>
 A noble life before a long, and wish <br>
 To jump a body with a dangerous physic<br>
 That's sure of death without it, at once pluck out<br>
 The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick<br>
 The sweet which is their poison: your dishonour<br>
 Mangles true judgment and bereaves the state<br>
 Of that integrity which should become't,<br>
 Not having the power to do the good it would,<br>
 For the in which doth control't. <br>

 As traitors do. </del><br>

<b>Coriolanus.</b> Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee!<br>
 What should the people do with these bald tribunes?<br>
 On whom depending, their obedience fails<br>
 To the greater bench: in a rebellion, <br>
 When what's not meet, but what must be, was law,<br>
 Then were they chosen: in a better hour,<br>
 Let what is meet be said it must be meet,<br>
 And throw their power i' the dust.

 Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,<br>
 Or rudely visit them in parts remote, <br>
 To fright them, ere destroy. But come in:<br>

You shall know now that I am in estimation; you shall<br>
perceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me from <br>
my son Coriolanus: guess, but by my entertainment<br>
with him, if thou standest not i' the state of<br>
hanging, or of some death more long in<br>
spectatorship, and crueller in suffering; behold now<br>
presently, and swoon for what's to come upon thee. <br>
[To CORIOLANUS]<br>
The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy<br>
particular prosperity, and love thee no worse than<br>
thy old father Menenius does! O my son, my son!<br>
thou art preparing fire for us; look thee, here's <br>
water to quench it. I was hardly moved to come to<br>
thee; but being assured none but myself could move<br>
thee, I have been blown out of your gates with<br>
sighs; and conjure thee to pardon Rome, and thy<br>
petitionary countrymen. The good gods assuage thy <br>
wrath, and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet<br>
here,â€”this, who, like a block, hath denied my<br>
access to thee.

Hath an aspect of intercession, which<br>
Great nature cries 'Deny not.' let the Volsces<br>

As if a man were author of himself <br>
And knew no other kin.

how honour would become such a person. that it was
no better than picture-like to hang by the wall, if
renown made it not stir, was pleased to let him seek
danger where he was like to find fame. To a cruel 
war I sent him; from whence he returned, his brows
bound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not

than now in first seeing he had proved himself a
man.

If it were so that our request did tend<br>
To save the Romans, thereby to destroy<br>
The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us,<br>
As poisonous of your honour: no; our suit<br>
Is that you reconcile them: while the Volsces<br>
May say 'This mercy we have show'd;' the Romans,<br>
'This we received;' and each in either side<br>
Give the all-hail to thee and cry 'Be blest <br>
For making up this peace!' Thou know'st, great son,<br>
The end of war's uncertain, but this certain,<br>
That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit<br>
Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name,<br>
Whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses;<br>
Whose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble,<br>
But with his last attempt he wiped it out;<br>
Destroy'd his country, and his name remains<br>
To the ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son:<br>
Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour,<br>
To imitate the graces of the gods;<br>
To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air,<br>
And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt<br>
That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?<br>
Think'st thou it honourable for a noble man<br>
Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:<br>
He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy:<br>
Perhaps thy childishness will move him more<br>
Than can our reasons. There's no man in the world<br>
More bound to 's mother; yet here he lets me prate<br>
Like one i' the stocks. Thou hast never in thy life<br>
Show'd thy dear mother any courtesy,<br>
When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,<br>
Has cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home,<br>
Loaden with honour. Say my request's unjust,<br>
And spurn me back: but if it be not so,<br>
Thou art not honest; and the gods will plague thee,<br>
That thou restrain'st from me the duty which<br>
To a mother's part belongs. He turns away:<br>
Down, ladies; let us shame him with our knees.<br>
To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride<br>
Than pity to our prayers. Down: an end;<br>
This is the last: so we will home to Rome,<br>
And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold 's:<br>
This boy, that cannot tell what he would have<br>
But kneels and holds up bands for fellowship,<br>
Does reason our petition with more strength<br>
Than thou hast to deny 't. Come, let us go:<br>
This fellow had a Volscian to his mother;<br>
His wife is in Corioli and his child<br>
Like him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch:<br>
I am hush'd until our city be a-fire,<br>
And then I'll speak a little.
