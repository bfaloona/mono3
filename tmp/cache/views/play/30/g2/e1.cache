          ... if my son were my husband, I
should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he
won honour than in the embracements of his bed where
he would show most love. When yet he was but
tender-bodied and the only son of my womb, when
youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way, when
for a day of kings' entreaties a mother should not
sell him an hour from her beholding, I, considering
how honour would become such a person. that it was
no better than picture-like to hang by the wall, if
renown made it not stir, was pleased to let him seek
danger where he was like to find fame. To a cruel 
war I sent him; from whence he returned, his brows
bound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not
more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child
than now in first seeing he had proved himself a
man.

I would dissemble with my nature where<br>
My fortunes and my friends at stake required<br>
I should do so in honour: I am in this,<br>
Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;<br>
And you will rather show our general louts <br>
How you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em,<br>
For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard<br>
Of what that want might ruin.

We have led since thy exile. Think with thyself<br>
How more unfortunate than all living women<br>

Making the mother, wife and child to see<br>

Thine enmity's most capital: thou barr'st us<br>
Our prayers to the gods, which is a comfort<br>
That all but we enjoy; for how can we,<br>
Alas, how can we for our country pray.<br>
Whereto we are bound, together with thy victory, <br>
Whereto we are bound? alack, or we must lose<br>
The country, our dear nurse, or else thy person,<br>
Our comfort in the country. We must find<br>
An evident calamity, though we had<br>
Our wish, which side should win: for either thou <br>
Must, as a foreign recreant, be led<br>
With manacles thorough our streets, or else<br>
triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin,<br>
And bear the palm for having bravely shed<br>
Thy wife and children's blood. For myself, son, <br>
I purpose not to wait on fortune till<br>
These wars determine: if I cannot persuade thee<br>
Rather to show a noble grace to both parts<br>
Than seek the end of one, thou shalt no sooner<br>
March to assault thy country than to tread‚Äî <br>
Trust to't, thou shalt not‚Äîon thy mother's womb,<br>
That brought thee to this world.

          Nay, go not from us thus.<br>
If it were so that our request did tend<br>
To save the Romans, thereby to destroy<br>
The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us,<br>
As poisonous of your honour: no; our suit<br>
Is that you reconcile them: while the Volsces<br>
May say 'This mercy we have show'd;' the Romans,<br>
'This we received;' and each in either side<br>
Give the all-hail to thee and cry 'Be blest <br>
For making up this peace!' Thou know'st, great son,<br>
The end of war's uncertain, but this certain,<br>
That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit<br>
Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name,<br>
Whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses;<br>
Whose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble,<br>
But with his last attempt he wiped it out;<br>
Destroy'd his country, and his name remains<br>
To the ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son:<br>
Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour,<br>
To imitate the graces of the gods;<br>
To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air,<br>
And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt<br>
That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?<br>
Think'st thou it honourable for a noble man<br>
Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:<br>
He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy:<br>
Perhaps thy childishness will move him more<br>
Than can our reasons. There's no man in the world<br>
More bound to 's mother; yet here he lets me prate<br>
Like one i' the stocks. Thou hast never in thy life<br>
Show'd thy dear mother any courtesy,<br>
When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,<br>
Has cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home,<br>
Loaden with honour. Say my request's unjust,<br>
And spurn me back: but if it be not so,<br>
Thou art not honest; and the gods will plague thee,<br>
That thou restrain'st from me the duty which<br>
To a mother's part belongs. He turns away:<br>
Down, ladies; let us shame him with our knees.<br>
To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride<br>
Than pity to our prayers. Down: an end;<br>
This is the last: so we will home to Rome,<br>
And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold 's:<br>
This boy, that cannot tell what he would have<br>
But kneels and holds up bands for fellowship,<br>
Does reason our petition with more strength<br>
Than thou hast to deny 't. Come, let us go:<br>
This fellow had a Volscian to his mother;<br>
His wife is in Corioli and his child<br>
Like him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch:<br>
I am hush'd until our city be a-fire,<br>
And then I'll speak a little.
