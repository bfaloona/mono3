But to fine issues, nor Nature never lends<br>
The smallest scruple of her excellence<br>
But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines<br>
Herself the glory of a creditor,<br>
Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech<br>
To one that can my part in him advertise;<br>
Hold therefore, Angelo:â€”<br>
In our remove be thou at full ourself;<br>
Mortality and mercy in Vienna<br>
Live in thy tongue and heart: old Escalus,<br>
Though first in question, is thy secondary.<br>
Take thy commission.

 Awakes me all the enrolled penalties<br>

 Having bound up the threatening twigs of birch,<br>
 Only to stick it in their children's sight <br>

 Becomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees,<br>
 Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead;<br>

 The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart <br>
 Goes all decorum.

The weariest and most loathed worldly life<br>
That age, ache, penury and imprisonment<br>
Can lay on nature is a paradise<br>
To what we fear of death. <br>

          This forenam'd maid hath yet in her the continuance<br>
of her first affection: his unjust unkindness, that<br>
in all reason should have quenched her love, hath,<br>
like an impediment in the current, made it more<br>
violent and unruly. Go you to Angelo; answer his<br>
requiring with a plausible obedience; agree with <br>
his demands to the point; only refer yourself to<br>
this advantage, first, that your stay with him may<br>
not be long; that the time may have all shadow and<br>
silence in it; and the place answer to convenience.<br>
This being granted in course,â€”and now follows <br>
all,â€”we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up<br>
your appointment, go in your place; if the encounter<br>
acknowledge itself hereafter, it may compel him to<br>
her recompense: and here, by this, is your brother<br>
saved, your honour untainted, the poor Mariana <br>
advantaged, and the corrupt deputy scaled. The maid<br>
will I frame and make fit for his attempt. If you<br>
think well to carry this as you may, the doubleness<br>
of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof.<br>
What think you of it? <br>

of profession: one would think it were Mistress
Overdone's own house, for here be many of her old
customers. First, here's young Master Rash; he's in
for a commodity of brown paper and old ginger,
ninescore and seventeen pounds; of which he made
five marks, ready money: marry, then ginger was not
much in request, for the old women were all dead.
Then is there here one Master Caper, at the suit of
Master Three-pile the mercer, for some four suits of
peach-coloured satin, which now peaches him a
beggar. Then have we here young Dizy, and young
Master Deep-vow, and Master Copperspur, and Master
Starve-lackey the rapier and dagger man, and young
Drop-heir that killed lusty Pudding, and Master
Forthlight the tilter, and brave Master Shooty the
great traveller, and wild Half-can that stabbed
Pots, and, I think, forty more; all great doers in
our trade, and are now 'for the Lord's sake.'
