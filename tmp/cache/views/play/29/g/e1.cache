With most delicious poison. Think on me,<br>
That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,<br>
And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,<br>
When thou wast here above the ground, I was <br>
A morsel for a monarch: and great Pompey<br>
Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;<br>
There would he anchor his aspect and die<br>
With looking on his life.

With one that I have bred? The gods! it smites me<br>
Beneath the fall I have.<br>

          <b>Domitius Enobarus.</b> I will tell you.<br>
      The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,<br>
      Burn'd on the water: the poop was beaten gold;<br>
      Purple the sails, and so perfumed that<br>
      The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,<br>
      Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made<br>
      The water which they beat to follow faster,<br>
      As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,<br>
      It beggar'd all description: she did lie<br>
      In her pavilion.cloth-of-gold of tissue.<br>
      O'er-picturing that Venus where we see<br>
      The fancy outwork nature: on each side her<br>
      Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,<br>
      With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem<br>
      To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,<br>
      And what they undid did. <br><br>

<del><b>Agrippa.</b> O, rare for Antony!</del><br><br>

<b>Domitius Enobarus.</b> <br>
Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,<br>
      So many mermaids, tended her i' the eyes,<br>
      And made their bends adornings: at the helm<br>
      A seeming mermaid steers: the silken tackle<br>
      Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands,<br>
      That yarely frame the office. From the barge<br>
      A strange invisible perfume hits the sense<br>
      Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast<br>
      Her people out upon her; and Antony,<br>
      Enthroned i' the market-place, did sit alone,<br>
      Whistling to the air; which, but for vacancy,<br>
      Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,<br>
      And made a gap in nature. <br><br>

<del><b>Agrippa.</b> Rare Egyptian!</del><br><br> 

<b>Domitius Enobarus.</b><br> 
Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,<br>
      Invited her to supper: she replied,<br>
      It should be better he became her guest;<br>
      Which she entreated: our courteous Antony,<br>
      Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak,<br>
      Being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast, <br>
      And for his ordinary pays his heart<br>
      For what his eyes eat only. <br><br>

<del><b>Agrippa.</b> Royal wench!<br>
      She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed:<br>
      He plough'd her, and she cropp'd. <br></del><br><br>

<b>Domitius Enobarus.</b> I saw her once<br>
      Hop forty paces through the public street;<br>
      And having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted,<br>
      That she did make defect perfection,<br>
      And, breathless, power breathe forth. <br><br>

<del><b>Mecaenas.</b> Now Antony must leave her utterly. </del><br><br>

<b>Domitius Enobarus.</b> Never; he will not:<br>
      Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale<br>
      Her infinite variety: other women cloy<br>
      The appetites they feed: but she makes hungry <br>
      Where most she satisfies; for vilest things<br>
      Become themselves in her: that the holy priests<br>
      Bless her when she is riggish.

          If that thy father live, let him repent<br>
Thou wast not made his daughter; and be thou sorry<br>
To follow Caesar in his triumph, since<br>
Thou hast been whipp'd for following him: henceforth<br>
The white hand of a lady fever thee,<br>
Shake thou to look on 't. Get thee back to Caesar,<br>
Tell him thy entertainment: look, thou say<br>
He makes me angry with him; for he seems<br>
Proud and disdainful, harping on what I am,<br>
Not what he knew I was: he makes me angry;<br>
And at this time most easy 'tis to do't,<br>
When my good stars, that were my former guides,<br>
Have empty left their orbs, and shot their fires<br>
Into the abysm of hell. If he mislike<br>
My speech and what is done, tell him he has<br>
Hipparchus, my enfranched bondman, whom<br>
He may at pleasure whip, or hang, or torture,<br>
As he shall like, to quit me: urge it thou:<br>
Hence with thy stripes, begone!

<b>Eros.</b> What would my lord?</del> <br><br>

<b>Antony.</b> Since Cleopatra died,<br>
      I have lived in such dishonour, that the gods<br>
      Detest my baseness. I, that with my sword <br>
      Quarter'd the world, and o'er green Neptune's back<br>
      With ships made cities, condemn myself to lack<br>
      The courage of a woman; less noble mind<br>
      Than she which by her death our Caesar tells<br>
      'I am conqueror of myself.' Thou art sworn, Eros,<br>
      That, when the exigent should come, which now<br>
      Is come indeed, when I should see behind me<br>
      The inevitable prosecution of<br>
      Disgrace and horror, that, on my command,<br>
      Thou then wouldst kill me: do't; the time is come:<br>
      Thou strikest not me, 'tis Caesar thou defeat'st.<br>
      Put colour in thy cheek. <br><br>

<del><b>Eros.</b> The gods withhold me!<br>
      Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts,<br>
      Though enemy, lost aim, and could not? </del><br><br>

<b>Antony.</b> Eros,<br>
      Wouldst thou be window'd in great Rome and see<br>
      Thy master thus with pleach'd arms, bending down<br>
      His corrigible neck, his face subdued<br>
      To penetrative shame, whilst the wheel'd seat<br>
      Of fortunate Caesar, drawn before him, branded<br>
      His baseness that ensued? <br><br>

<del><b>Eros.</b> I would not see't.</del> <br><br>

<b>Antony.</b> Come, then; for with a wound I must be cured.<br>
      Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn <br>
      Most useful for thy country. <br><br>

<del><b>Eros.</b> O, sir, pardon me!</del> <br><br>

<b>Antony.</b> When I did make thee free, sworest thou not then<br>
      To do this when I bade thee? Do it at once;<br>
      Or thy precedent services are all<br>
      But accidents unpurposed. Draw, and come.<br><br> 

<del><b>Eros.</b> Turn from me, then, that noble countenance,<br>
      Wherein the worship of the whole world lies. </del><br><br>

<b>Antony.</b> Lo thee! <br><br>

[Turning from him]<br><br>

<del><b>Eros.</b> My sword is drawn. </del><br><br>

<b>Antony.</b> Then let it do at once<br>
      The thing why thou hast drawn it. <br><br>

<del><b>Eros.</b> My dear master,<br>
      My captain, and my emperor, let me say,<br>
      Before I strike this bloody stroke, farewell. </del><br><br>

<b>Antony.</b> 'Tis said, man; and farewell. <br><br>

<del><b>Eros.</b> Farewell, great chief. Shall I strike now? </del><br><br>

<b>Antony.</b> Now, Eros. <br><br>

<del><b>Eros.</b> Why, there then: thus I do escape the sorrow <br>
      Of Antony's death. </del><br><br>

[Kills himself]<br><br>

<b>Antony.</b> Thrice-nobler than myself!<br>
      Thou teachest me, O valiant Eros, what<br>
      I should, and thou couldst not. My queen and Eros<br>
      Have by their brave instruction got upon me<br>
      A nobleness in record: but I will be<br>
      A bridegroom in my death, and run into't<br>
      As to a lover's bed. Come, then; and, Eros,<br>
      Thy master dies thy scholar: to do thus<br>
      [Falling on his sword]<br>
      I learn'd of thee. How! not dead? not dead?<br>
      The guard, ho! O, dispatch me!
